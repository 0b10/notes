# A Guide to Developing a SaaS App

## Guides

* Study and follow [the 12 factor app][12-factor-app], which is a short and concise guide covering best practices;
* Watch [Pawel Brzeminski's lean product process][pawel-lean-product-process] for some light inspiration. It's short (10m) and very closely related to [Eric Ries' book][tlpp].
