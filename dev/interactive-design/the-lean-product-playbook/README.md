# Key Takeaways

* Start with meeting a target market needs, not an idea/solution
* Make/refine hypotheses based on data, then test is
  * Use a data driven approach to measure customer satisfaction
* Iteratively model your customer with personas, express your hypotheses
* Deeply understand the customer needs, and be very pragmatic.
* Use iterative interviews/surveys to dig deeper
* Define the product value proposition as a list of needs to be addressed
* Focus on a small set of the most important needs, reducing risk -- say "no" lots.
* The goal of an MVP is quick development, and fast feedback. You can test if an idea will take off, and minimise cost and risk if it does not
* Selecting features for an MVP is a balance between high opportunity (demand) features, and cost of implementation -- it's a measured and purposeful process
* Test and iterate on the product layout, user interaction, general experience and visuals -- gauging on usability and delight
* Bridge the feature set with design metaphors (aka conceptual model), you must deeply understand the target users

* [Adoption Life-cycle Notes][adoption-lifecycle]
* [Persona Template][persona-template]

### Summary

You must target a specific market - a group of potential customers with specific attributes -- called a market segment. Understand your customer's profile (needs, wants, attributes) and model them early.

To model them you would use personas. Personas allow you to capture your hypotheses in a more tangible form. Personas are not real people, but are based on individual real customers, and are never an average or generalised profile.

Personas can be derived from data captured through interviews or surveys. Another source for personas can be the ["technology adoption lifecycle framework"][adoption-lifecycle]. You should understand the development stage your product is in, and the kind of customer it's likely to attract -- via the aforementioned framework.

* The target customer
  * Product development should be driven by the customer's needs
* Market
  * Markets are groups of people bound by some common attributes - demographics, psychographics, behavioural characteristics, and needs.
    * The business equivalent of demographics is firmographics
  * Market segmentation occurs around common attributes of customers
  * Determine a market segment to target -- this may require higher level reasoning outside the scope of this book
  * The economic buyer may not be the person using the product, and the user may influence the economic buyer
* Technology adoption lifecycle
  * A simple framework for understanding customer personalities, relative to new technology adoption
  * Understand what stage your product is in, and determine who will typically be adopting it
* The technology adoption lifecycle is a simple framework 
* Personas
  * Used early to capture hypotheses about the target customer
  * Represents real people, not averages -- hypothetical archetypes of actual users
  * Iterate until they are accurate -- pragmatic
  * Use a [template][persona-template] and fit it on a single page
  * Capture attributes like demographics, psychographics, behavioural, and needs
  * You can source information from interviews or surveys

* [Laddering Notes][laddering]

### Summary

Initially, you will make a guess at a set of hypotheses. You will then derive a set of customer benefits, prepare questions, and conduct an interview.

The purpose of the interview is to test hypothesis against the declared benefits through carefully created question. Questions measure the importance and satisfaction with each proposed benefit -- relative to competition, and to discover new needs. Use techniques like [laddering][laddering] to discover related benefits, or common root benefits. The newly discovered benefits feed a revised set of hypotheses, from which a revised set of benefits is derived.

Plot and reason about the data, systematically discover opportunities, and repeat the entire process until statistical opportunities are at a point of high importance, and high satisfaction (which has been captured relative to the competition).

* Hypothesis
  * Initially a guess when there's no data to go on
  * Create a set of hypotheses, each one serves as a foundation for a benefit 
  * Derived directly from customer feedback -- their needs and pain points
  * Focus on the problem space (no solutions permitted)
  * Are there related needs? Common root need?
* Benefits
  * Are needs written from the perspective of the customer
  * Derived from hypotheses, each hypothesis underpins a benefit
* Interviews
  * Are used to test hypotheses - how true are they?
    * (Adequate questions are defined in the mindmap and activity diagram)
  * Comparing to competitors means the data reflects relative quality
  * Determine goals/needs and pain points
    * [Laddering][laddering] helps to uncover common root,or related needs
      * Recursively enquiring about answers until you hit an atomic need -- go deep
      * This can simplify the hypothesis (common root), or reveal a set of related needs -- needs that must be addressed together
  * Importance and satisfaction are used to assess opportunity -- further research and development 
* [Frameworks][customer-discovery-frameworks]
  * Plot importance/satisfaction
  * Use to track progress, and reveal opportunity
  * Opportunity is low satisfaction, high importance -- high importance is paramount

## Chapter 5: Define Your Value Proposition

* [Mindmap](part-ii-the-lean-product-process/5-define-your-value-proposition/mindmap.png?raw=true)
* [Value Proposition Template][value-proposition-template]

### Summary

In order to define a successful value proposition you need to focus on **high importance/high value** needs -- it's not worth your time pursuing needs that are already met with high satisfaction. Focus on a small set of needs to reduce committed resources, and reduce risk in case of a product failure.

These needs, when structured with the [Kano model][kano-model] will be categorised into three sets. The most competitive category is the performance benefits, in which you will focus on the most importance benefit. You must be better than your competitors for that benefit, and you must also at least match all other performance benefits to overcome the competition. Must-haves are non-negotiable, and form a critical dependency for your product. Markets with high satisfaction are hard to dethrone the competition. 

Use the [value proposition template][value-proposition-template] to clarify your product benefits, and easily compare them. The list of benefits for your product form your value proposition.


* Needs
  * [Kano model][kano-model]
    * Must-haves
      * Non-negotiable, and you must match your competitors
    * Performance
      * How the product performs -- not just in speed, but in results, latency, effectiveness, UX and a number of other areas
      * You must at least match all of your competitors performance benefits
      * You must win on the most important benefit, with respect to your competitors -- as determined through customer data
      * This is where the competition is, and is the most important category of benefit
    * Delighters
      * Unique features not offered by your customers
      * Provides extra value
      * Not as important as performance
  * Focus
    * An MVP reduces risk -- if you get it wrong, not too many resources have been committed 
    * Focus on eliminating benefits until what you are left with is a small subset of the most important benefits -- as defined through customer feedback/data
    * Don't commit too many resources -- reduces risk 
    * Only focus on **high importance**, **low satisfaction** needs
* [Value Proposition Template][value-proposition-template]
  * The benefits defined by your own product is its value proposition
  * You can use the template to make projections -- aka "product strategy"

## Chapter 6: Specify Your MVP Feature Set

* [Activity Diagram][mvp-features-activity-diagram]
* [Prioritised Feature Chunk Table][prioritised-feature-chunk-table]


### Summary

You first want to focus on a subset of features from the value proposition. You will use the chosen features in a brainstorming session, and formalise them in user stories -- this makes them testable with user acceptance testing, and keeps them clear.

Next you will "chunk" the user stories into smaller scope, which decreases the risk due to a smaller scope and faster feedback time. It's also easier to understand and estimate smaller stories. A priority should be assigned to each chunk, either a customer derived importance statistic, or a developer projected user importance rating. Chunking only stops when all chunks are atomic.

You will then process them by categorising them by their associated benefit, accept or reject them based on their feasibility, and prioritise them via an ROI. Once you have processed them you are to select the top 3-5 priority stories per benefit -- considering any dependencies.

Finally you will organise all of the features in terms of their priority, and category in a ["prioritised feature chunk table"][prioritised-feature-chunk-table]. All of the must-haves, the top performance benefit, and the top delighter will form the features for the MVP.

* User stories
  * Used the capture features in brainstorming sessions
  * Keeps customer benefits clear, and discrete
  * Testable via user acceptance testing
  * INVEST: independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, testable
* Priorities
  * User define importance assigned to each benefit -- through data collection
  * Projected user defined value, assigned by the developer
  * ROI - derived from value/cost, where the value is projected customer value, or actual customer importance, and cost is any relevant metric -- like story points, time, revenue etc.
* Brain storming
  * Use divergent thinking - get ideas down, don't worry about viability (within reason) or cost etc.
  * Produce a number of ideas per benefit
  * Address each benefit
  * Capture ideas in the form of user stories
* Story points
  * A value that estimates the cost of implementing a certain story
  * Assigned story points over a certain threshold means the story is chunked
* Chunking
  * Subdivide large stories into smaller stories
  * Reduces the scope
  * Makes them easier to reason about and estimate
  * Faster feedback, reduces the risk
  * Assign priorities and scope to each new chunk
* Capture/Process
  * Review: are they viable?
  * Score: user story points - which convey the difficulty of implementing the feature
  * Organise: arrange ideas with their associated benefit
  * Prioritise: this is ROI = value/cost, which is ratio between the customer value and the cost of implementation -- time or development cost, like story points. Any metric can be used for the cost.
* [Prioritised feature chunk table][prioritised-feature-chunk-table]
  * Based on the [Kano model][kano-model], and used must-haves, performance, benefits, and delighters
  * Each benefit has a number of features/user stories associated with it
  * Features/user stories are assigned a priority, and features/stories of high priority align to the left
  * It's important to use an adequate metric for priority -- ROI is a good candidate

### Notes

What I don't like about this process: brainstorming, chunking, and processing features that are of lower customer importance.

Since you will have the data, a more efficient approach would be to select only the necessary features of the highest customer importance, before processing.

Using the [Kano model][kano-model], choose:
* Must-haves
* Most important performance benefit
* Most important delighter

However, this has some drawbacks:

1. You won't get a high level overview of all the features, their scope, and priority
1. The prioritised feature chunk table will organise features based on their customer value, and cost of implementation -- which means lower priority features will naturally not be implemented first.

This idea means less up-front planning, so less risk when needs inevitably change, but it also means a smaller overall picture.

### Summary

The goal is to initially test market interest in your specific product, its value proposition, and to improve engagement/conversions. Then to iteratively test UX design, until you reach an MVP that suitably attracts interest, and satisfies customer UX needs. To get there, you will need to employ a data-driven approach, with a good balance between qualitative and quantitative sources.

#### Start with Marketing Validation

To start, quantitative data can be collected from marketing materials like landing pages (aka smoke test), crowdfunding engagement, ad campaigns, explainer/product videos. The value proposition should be clear in all cases. To get useful data you should track engagement, from which you will iteratively test new designs/approaches. This whole process should give you insights into interest for the product.

Qualitative data can also be collected from marketing material like landing pages, with methods like the "5 second test". Qualitative data gives you valuable opinions, and direction for new ideas to increasing engagement and interest.

#### Then Move Onto Product Validation

Once you have validated market interest, and your marketing approach, you can move onto product (UX) validation which is all about ensuring the customer sees value.

To validate the UX you should start with a low fidelity prototype, and rapidly iterate on designs moving up in fidelity towards an eventual live product -- the MVP. For each phase you should collect qualitative and quantitative data.

Qualitative data consists of things like customer opinions, and are collected via methods like -- sketches, wireframes, mockups, interactive prototypes, and the Wizard of Oz technique.

Quantitative data can be collected through A/B testing, product analytics, and the fake door technique. Each of which allow you to test engagement in designs, and the effects of changes on key performance metrics -- such as conversion rate.

Eventually you will reach the live product phase, which tests real issues such as latency, load performance, response times etc. The end goal for the live product is to have developed a suitable and complete UX for a **minimum feature set** -- see the [MVP pyramid][mvp-pyramid].

### The UX Team

UX Teams consist of interaction a designer, visual designer, frontend developer, and a product manager. An interaction designer is responsible for the measuring and developing the interaction between the product and the user. A visual designer is responsible for the look and feel -- which colour, visual hierarchies, placement etc.

### Design Principles

Design principles are used to ensure a proven UX:

* **visual hierarchy** (colour/size/placement/contrast): elements are first ordered by importance, then placed according to guiding principles
* **Gestalt principle**: related elements are placed close to each other, unrelated elements are not, and are also always visually differentiated
* **principles of composition**: unity, contrast, balance, and use of space -- do elements sit well together; do high important elements contrast; is there a visual weight/colour balance; and is there adequate use of spacing?

### Primary Concerns

Two important aspects of UX are usability, and delight. Usability is concerned with efficiency (effort/flow/learnability/cognitive load), ease of use, and the tasks users perform. Usability is achieved through developed personas, and user tested -- through various metrics of interaction, while the user performs user centric tasks and goals.  Delight is concerned with user emotions, aesthetics, simplicity, pre-emptive actions or state -- like smart defaults, personality, and even surprise -- e.g. funny 404 pages.

### The UX Iceberg

The entire UX layer in the [PMF pyramid][2] can be expressed as the [UX iceberg][3]. The [UX iceberg][3] consists of, in order:

1. **Visual design**: the part that the user sees and is responsible for reinforcing the visual hierarchy, brand personality, user delight and differentiating your product from competitors. The way these responsibilities are achieved is through conveying emotion and contrast with **colour**, style and visual hierarchy with **typography**, **graphics** (which are critical for conversion rates), consistency with **style guides** and [**layout grids**][4]. Visual design UX is attained through gradually increasing the fidelity of prototypes, eventually reaching mockups -- which provide a rich interactive user experience. Each phase in fidelity is carefully tested, and feeds back into prototype iteration.
1. **Interaction design**: deals with how the user interacts with the product -- input, feedback, navigation (flow) etc. A flowchart can be used to model the interaction and navigation. Wireframes should be used to gather user feedback on the layout, UX, and general interaction. Divergent thinking should be applied to brainstorm *all* ideas (even bad ones) derived from feedback, making sure not to narrow the choice of solutions too early -- test and see. How the user interacts with the product is often tied quite closely to the conceptual design -- e.g. a shopping cart.
1. **Information architecture**: is concerned with the arrangements of feature set elements, optimised for findability -- which is the focus for user tests. A technique to optimise organisation is card sorting, where each element is a card and the user arranges them. Card sorting, and producing the resulting prototype, is an iterative process, and feedback from tests is measured for optimisation. Another technique for optimising findability is through analytics of the prototype, measuring the number of steps/time taken to achieve a goal. A model that can be used to express the architecture called a [site map][1], which expresses the interaction with elements in a hierarchical way.
1. **Conceptual design**: is essentially a design metaphor, and is supposed to resonate with the intended audience in a stylistic or intuitive way -- aiding learnability. A product can implement many conceptual designs -- such as a shopping cart, being only a small part of the product. The conceptual design layers sits just above the feature set layer of the [PMF pyramid][2], and forms the bridge between the feature set and the itself. Often, this bridge is what drives product innovation. To bridge this gap you have to engage in *deep* user research, building personas -- while modelling the **context** and **technical abilities** in addition to the attributes that personas typically model. User research is conducted through interviews, usability tests, and surveys -- documenting the summary of results and key takeaways, which facilitates and simplifies learning capture. Other team members should be directly involved in the research, like product team members, so that they can observe the results first-hand -- which is a far more effective means to communicate lessons learned when compared to a second-hand report.
