**Summary**

Initially, you will make a guess at a set of hypotheses. You will then derive a set of customer benefits, prepare questions, and conduct an interview.

The purpose of the interview is to test hypothesis against the declared benefits through carefully created question. Questions measure the importance and satisfaction with each proposed benefit -- relative to competition, and to discover new needs. Use techniques like laddering to discover related benefits, or common root benefits. The newly discovered benefits feed a revised set of hypotheses, from which a revised set of benefits is derived.

Plot and reason about the data, systematically discover opportunities, and repeat the entire process until statistical opportunities are at a point of high importance, and high satisfaction (which has been captured relative to the competition).

* Hypothesis
  * Initially a guess when there's no data to go on
  * Create a set of hypotheses, each one serves as a foundation for a benefit 
  * Derived directly from customer feedback -- their needs and pain points
  * Focus on the problem space (no solutions permitted)
  * Are there related needs? Common root need?
* Benefits
  * Are needs written from the perspective of the customer
  * Derived from hypotheses, each hypothesis underpins a benefit
* Interviews
  * Are used to test hypotheses - how true are they?
    * (Adequate questions are defined in the mindmap and activity diagram)
  * Comparing to competitors means the data reflects relative quality
  * Determine goals/needs and pain points
    * Laddering helps to uncover common root,or related needs
      * Recursively enquiring about answers until you hit an atomic need -- go deep
      * This can simplify the hypothesis (common root), or reveal a set of related needs -- needs that must be addressed together
  * Importance and satisfaction are used to assess opportunity -- further research and development 
* Frameworks
  * Plot importance/satisfaction
  * Use to track progress, and reveal opportunity
  * Opportunity is low satisfaction, high importance -- high importance is paramount
