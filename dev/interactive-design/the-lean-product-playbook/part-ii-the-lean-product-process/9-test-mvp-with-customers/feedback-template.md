This table shows you how to record results from the interviews.

This will reflect the interview script, and also any feedback the user gives. So if a user mentions something that's not in the script it's included in this table. Other users may mention the same thing.

Each wave of user tests involves new users, so the same gripes between waves shows a pattern, and at the very least it should be improving in terms of user satisfaction. The absence of a gripe between waves shows improvement.

Key ratings, such as ease of use, should also improve between waves.
