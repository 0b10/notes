Frameworks used to discover customer needs, importance of needs, value of benefits (hypothesis), and to determine which benefits make the most sense to implement.

*Importance vs Satisfaction*

This framework is primarily visual, but the following equations allow you to determine the statistical significance in a single number.

Determine the opportunity for a need:

> Opportunity = importance * (1 - satisfaction)

Alternatively:

> Opportunity = importance - current value delivered


Determine how much value is delivered to the customer -- the area of the scatter plot:

> Value delivered = importance * satisfaction

Determine the delta for the value delivered to the customer:

> Value delivered = importance * (satisfaction before - satisfaction after)

*Jobs to be Done*

This framework makes importance a key factor for determining opportunity. The resulting sum differs slightly in value depending on the importance of the need - which means it captures importance.

> Opportunity = importance + Max(importance - satisfaction, 0)

*Kano Model*

Uses a hierarchy of needs:

1. Must-haves
1. Performance needs
1. Delighters (measure unexpectedness of benefit)
