# Prioritised Feature Chunk Table

* Each chunk is grouped by their benefit type
* Leftmost has highest priority
* Priority is defined via some method like ROI
* Future versions can also be planned, but only a couple of minor releases because feedback and iteration is likely to change things
* For the first candidate choose the top performance benefit, all of the must-haves, and the top delighter

(These chunks are poorly named, so don't be confused)
