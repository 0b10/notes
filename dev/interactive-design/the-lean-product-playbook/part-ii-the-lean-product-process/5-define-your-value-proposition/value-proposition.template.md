# Product Value Proposition Template

For new products not yet built, you can list the scores you plan to achieve, otherwise just list scores as determined by customers.

* Must-haves are a simple Yes|No answer
* Delighters are typically a Yes|No answer simply because they tend to be unique, and there's likely no competition
* The "My Product" column is the value proposition
* For product strategy, you can include an extra column for each product owner that projects the future state of each benefit.
