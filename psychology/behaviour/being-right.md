# Beware of Being Right

## Summary

* **Don't seek power when devalued**: it's ego, and it's fragile, and it's a weakness -- be **objective**;
* **focus on the context**: being right/certain excludes the wider perspective, narrowing focus -- consider the other person, the environment, and the potential for being wrong;
* **certainty is an emotional state**: it filters out the wider context, it selfishly narrows your perspective, and can breed negativity;
* **it leads to contempt**: being right justifies contempt and disrespect, avoid this by mindful and **compassionate**;
* **don't dig in**: even when you are certain you are right, because it destroys relationships;

Don't dig in on being right, focus on the context objectively and be compassionate. Failure to do this results in a fragile ego, destroys relationships, and inevitably leads to power struggles and declining mental health.

## Notes

A lot of emotional suffering comes from substituting power with value. When a person feels devalued there is a tendency to seek power, to raise value. They grow their fragile egos, which needs more power for defence. This is commonly erroneously referred to narcissism. Power is closely related to the need to be right, which justifies disrespect and contempt. This creates an illusion of certainty and narrows mental focus excluding **consideration** in the process.

> It's why you're convinced that you're right and everyone else is wrong when you're angry.

> Certainty itself is an emotional state, not an intellectual one. To create a feeling of certainty, the brain must filter out far more information than it processes, which, of course, greatly increases its already high error rate during emotional arousal.

Focusing just on the aspects that create the certainty -- that thing you think makes you right, causes you to lose context, the bigger picture.

Relationships are often destroyed by this need to be right. It has such a magnetic pull that people, even when faced with destroying an important relationship, will often dig in, because they are *right*.

> I've had dozens of therapy client who confessed that they wished that they weren't right, as it would make their marriages so much easier.

Being "right" results in behaviours such as stonewalling, criticism, defensiveness, and contempt. Compassion and kindness are what successful relationships are built upon, not *being right*. Spend more time appreciating and understanding the differences, and less time on controlling what other people think.
