# Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion

## Summary

### 2. Reciprocation

[Mindmap][ch2-mindmap]

**Reciprocation** is the technique of providing a (solicited/unsolicited) favour with the intent on receiving something you want in return -- typically something larger. It's possible to choose the favour you want in return. How much the initiator is liked has little effect on the likelihood of reciprocation. Refusing a favour can induce a form of reciprocation, in that there is a lack of obligation to reciprocate.

**Reciprocal concession** occurs when an initial offer is made, rejected, and a second, more reasonable offer is accepted -- this leverages the **contrast principle**. This is also known as the reject-then-retreat technique. The larger the initial offer/demand (within reason), the more likely the second offer/demand will be accepted.  This is thought to work because the subject feels some **responsibility** over the concession. The subject also feels more **satisfied** with the outcome than those asked outright.

### 3. Commitment and Consistency

[Mindmap][ch3-mindmap]

> If I can get you to make a commitment, I will have set the stage for your automatic and ill considered consistency to that commitment.

Getting an initial **commitment** is called the **foot-in-the-door technique**, and subjects are more likely to be **consistent** with their initial commitments. The initial commitment can be small, and incrementally grown overtime, eventually reaching very large commitment. Commitments can come in many forms -- asking a favour, a hug, or a purchase etc.  The initial doesn't have to be related to the true intention, it can be just a token gesture. 

Generally speaking, a **consistency** is a cognitive shortcut that affords people less effort for managing information and their environment. It's this shortcut that's exploited through solicitation.  Consistency is so strong that sometimes people will follow through with obviously bad decisions to avoid dealing with some difficult reality -- like a debunked solution for a problem that really needs to be solved.

Commitment alters one's self image, and can be effectively achieved through public declarations or writing. One's self image can be changed incrementally, and incentivised with small concessions -- where the smaller the concession, the stronger the belief that the statement was an internalised choice. It's this internalised choice that's important, and studies have shown that it's far more effective than consequences. Commitments to ceremonies for exclusive groups heightens the initiated member's commitment, and strengthens group bonds.

Sometimes commitment and consistency are used in a more insidious way -- promises that must be kept, yet can't be fulfilled, can be leveraged for a larger return; simply asking for a benign statement or answer, only to be leveraged for gain at a later date; getting written commitment, offering a deal, then revoking said deal at a later date -- aka the **lowball technique**.

The end goal of commitment and consistency is to induce a commitment within the subject, changing their self image in the process, and then removing those inducements, and allowing the subject to pursue and grow that self image on their own. The self image changes can be fairly innocuous -- like environment conscientiousness.

## Intro

The thousands of persuasive tactics (commonly compliance tactics) the author has encountered boil down to 6 simple categories:

* consistency;
* reciprocation;
* social proof;
* authority;
* liking;
* scarcity.

There is also a seventh category that the author doesn't cover because he thinks it's too obvious to go into extensive descriptions about -- **self interest** -- specifically, that "people want the most and pay the least for their choices".

The author also examines each category for the attribute of people's willingness to say yes without thinking.

## 1. Weapons of Influence

[Mindmap][ch1-mindmap]

Animals have some "fixed-action patterns" that cause them to trigger some behaviour -- like courtship, or self defence. These fixed-action patters are akin to a tape recorder -- once it's started, it plays out in sequence.

Fixed-action patterns have a **trigger feature** -- like size, shape, noise of a predator or a mate. These can be triggered by imitations (similar objects) like something that resembles a predator, that causes the animal to activate a fixed-action pattern.

Humans have these fixed-action patterns and trigger features too.

> When we ask someone to do us a favour we will be more successful if we provide a reason,

When providing a reason, studies have shown a 94% success rate, as opposed to 60% success rate when no reason is provided, but the success isn't due to the reason, but rather the word "because" -- that's the trigger feature

This has a real reason:

> Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I am in a rush?

This one doesn't:

> Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I have to make copies?

Both of these had a ~94% success rate.

Another example of a trigger feature is price: customers perceive more expensive items as being better, and thus they sell easier -- this is a shortcut people take to evaluating the item's quality.

Humans take shortcuts to evaluating a busy environment, and often use stereotype and rules of thumb to classify things to a few key features. An automatic response often occurs when a trigger feature is encountered -- e.g. coupons that don't actually save you money, but redeemed just as often as coupons that do. We just assume that coupons save you something.

One technique that the book describes anecdotally is a tailor shop owner. A man who pretends to be partially deaf, and during the fitting, when asked for the price of the suit, he would call through to his brother. When the brother replies twice, through lack of hearing, the man would in turn quote an incorrect price to the customer -- half that of what his brother replied. This was an opportunity for the customer, but he was being duped.

The **contrast principle** defines a mechanism alter the perceptions of an object. Example: lifting a lighter object before a heavy object will make the heavier object seem heavier than it actually is. Sales people use this principle by presenting an expensive product before a cheaper product. Not doing so means that when the cheaper object is presented first, this principle will in fact work against you, by making the expensive object seem more expensive. Another example is upselling small add-ons to a large financial purchase, like a car. The small cost for each individual add-on seems like an insignificant burden, but they add up. The trick is to offer them individually, to keep them seemingly small. 
## 2. Reciprocation

> The rule says that we should repay, in kind, what another person has provided us.

The obligation to reciprocate kindness is pervasive in any society -- some more pervasive than others. It is said to form the basis of society with goods and services, and invokes a feeling of indebtedness. It's deeply embedded in our culture, and people are unconsciously taught to reciprocate actions.

A study covered in the book demonstrated that when a favour was done for a subject, they are likely to reciprocate a favour in return -- in the study, the favour was a can of Coke provided by another participant (assistant), the reciprocated behaviour was the subject purchasing raffle tickets. How much the participant liked the assistant is unrelated to how many tickets they bought, those that didn't like the assistant bought just as many as those who did -- reciprocation is **overpowering** in nature. Return favours can also be chosen for the subject, just like the raffle tickets.

It can also be used in an opposite manner, a subject refusing a favour/gift in times of need means that the subject doesn't feel indebted, and free to proceed without a necessity for reciprocation.

The favour/gift does not need to be solicited, because there is an **obligation to receive**. It can be simple in form -- like a gummed, individualised address label in a letter.

People can get wise to this tactic, so don't expect it to work repeatedly, unless the subject actually wants to re-engage

An anecdote in the book describes a situation where the Hare Krishnas flower gifts were being thrown into the bin by the subject, after they received their donation. The flowers were then fished out only to be recycled for the same purpose.

The reciprocation rule implies some zero-sum, even exchange, but often the exchange can be uneven. One reason is the burden of obligation is felt so negatively, it's often the case that a considerably larger favour can be returned. Another reason is that people who don't reciprocate are viewed negatively in social groups.

### Reciprocal Concessions

Another more subtle form of reciprocation is through concessions -- we are likely to reciprocate a concession. The example in the book was a boy scout selling $5 tickets, when the subject refused, the boy scout conceded and offered a $1 chocolate bar instead. The subject felt obligated, and conceded. Sometimes, if a person is being deceptive, the initial offer is actually just a decoy. This is the contrast principle at work.

> Heads I win, tails you lose.

[Mindmap][ch2-mindmap]

This is known as the **reject-then-retreat** technique.

The larger the initial request, the more successful the second request will be, but only up to a point. If the initial request is too large, the tactic will backfire. It will also backfire if it appears to be a transparent trick.

An anecdote from the book covers the script of a TV show -- some lines were deliberately provocative, knowing that the censors would cut it. Concessions were made to get the lines they actually wanted. The same text demonstrates the technique with the repeated use of a controversial word, hoping it would be cut down to a single use.

Another anecdote describes a door-to-door salesman deliberately getting the sales pitch rejected, only to retreat to a simple concession: getting referrals.

Retailers will demo the top-of-the-line, deluxe model first, then the concession.

Research has shown that that bad reactions are *less* likely to occur than just asking outright.

A Canadian study showed that the reject-then-retreat technique was 76% effective vs 29% effective when a subject was just asked outright. The follow-up (the subjects were asked to do community service) ended up with 85% of the reject-then-retreat subjects showing up, vs only 50% of the subjects that were asked outright. This study has been repeated, where the subjects were also asked to do something extra after they show up, and it showed that the reject-and-retreat subjects are significantly more likely to follow through, and to also volunteer for some other behaviour if asked.


There are two reasons why this technique works:

* **responsibility**: the subject feels that they have some control over the concession -- for example, in a negotiation, a concession, to a counter-negotiator, would feel like they were responsible for the result;
* **satisfaction**: the book describes an experiment, after which, the subjects who were the target for the reject-then-retreat technique recorded more satisfaction with the outcome than the other subjects. Subjects who are satisfied are more likely to engage with further requests.

### Dealing with it

Being the subject is not easy, it's not clear if the initial offer is genuine, or if it's an attempt to exploit you. Sometimes, a gift is just a gift.

One way to deal with it is to just accept the initial favour, and if it turns out to be a compliance device, then don't feel obligated to comply.

## 3. Commitment and Consistency

[Mindmap][ch3-mindmap]

The consistency principle describes the need for people to be consistent with previous decisions, thoughts, beliefs etc. even if it is detrimental to their own best interests.

One anecdote in the book describes two experiments, both involving a thief. In the first, a thief steals an object yet nobody intervenes. In the second, the subjects were asked to "watch my things", which yielded significantly more interventions when the thief tried to steal.

Consistency is associated with intellectual strength, logic, rationality, stability. Inconsistency is associated with indecisive, confused, two-faced, and even mentally ill. Good consistency is highly valued.

Consistency is a cognitive shortcut -- it allows people to avoid always having to think about an issue, which can be very taxing.

> There's no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labour of thinking -- Sir Joshua Reynolds

People will often hide behind **walls of consistency** to protect themselves from harsh realities. The anecdote in the book describes an obvious scam, a meditation group promising impossible things, yet after the presenters were challenged, people signed up in droves. Afterwards, it was found out that the subjects had problems that they wanted to believe could be solved. They chose to ignore the challenge because they had already mentally committed, and wanted the decision made before doubt crept in. They were consistent with their initial beliefs.

Toy companies will advertise certain toys prior to Christmas, then under-supply them. They bet on your making promises to your children. For Christmas you will probably have to substitute the toy because it's out of stock, and be true to your promise in January. The consistency principle being leveraged here is the promise made to your children.

### Commitment

Aka the **foot-in-the-door** technique.

> If I can get you to make a commitment, I will have set the stage for your automatic and ill considered consistency to that commitment.

**Commitment strategies** are employed by **compliance professionals** (yes, they actually exist), some of which are described in the book. One such example is a prior commitment to a cancer charity by asking subjects whether they'd commit to helping a cancer charity -- most people said yes. Days later, when asked to do the deed, that commitment yielded a 700% increase in respondents. Another example was simply asking residents if they think they would vote. The commitment was made, and voter turnout increased.

A more subtle commitment technique is to initiate dialogue by asking how the subject is feeling. When they respond positively, this creates a commitment to that general mood. The subjects are twice as likely to receive the solicitation than they are if they had received a simple, friendly initiating comment -- the question draws out the commitment. Furthermore, in the event of a follow-up, say a home visit (e.g. by invitation), it resulted in an 89% success rate for the solicitation (e.g. a sale) -- commitment pressure at work.

The commitment technique can be played out by soliciting an initial, small commitment. Then by incrementally increasing the size of each subsequent commitment.

> Almost any sale will do, because the purpose of that small transaction is not profit. It is commitment.

This technique can be used to eventually get a very large commitment from the subjects -- an anecdote in the book started with a small "drive safely sign", and ended up with a large billboard in the subjects front garden. The anecdotes often start with a commitment that nobody will refuse -- something almost everybody would agree to.

The larger commitment doesn't always need to be related to the initial one either, it really depends on what the subjects are committing to. In response to a experiment where subjects were initially asked to sign a petition, then to erect an unrelated billboard in their garden, Freedman and Fraser said:

> What may occur is the person's feelings about getting involved or taking action. Once he has agreed to an request, his attitude may change, he may become, in his own eyes, the kind of person who does this sort of thing, who agrees to requests made by strangers, who takes action on things he believes in, who cooperates with good causes.

This is really saying that such commitments can alter one's **self image**. Be careful with small, trivial commitments.

#### Written Commitment

People use their own actions to define their own beliefs -- self perception. The simple act of writing a statement can change self perception. Such an act can be forced upon people, and anecdotally, the book explains that POWs of the Korean War were forced to write statements. This was a driver to incrementally change a person's self image, and it was very successful.

Concessions were used (with the writings) to get initial commitments -- highly favourable statements about America, with small concessions leaning towards Communism. This was a small step towards conversion.

The act of writing a statement down has several layers to it: it drives self perception;
it can be shown to other people (who will have natural tendency to think it's true), convince them, and conversely convince yourself. People respond to what they perceive others think of them. One study found that when subjects were told that they were considered charitable, they gave larger chartable donations.

> What those those around us think is true of us is enormously important in determining what we ourselves think is true

A general, self commitment technique for those trying to achieve a goal:

> Set a goal an write it down

Some companies use a written commitment as a powerful technique to drastically reduce returns -- due to a "cooling off period" that's law in some states in the USA. This written statement usually comes in the form of a sales agreements, filled out by the customer.

Other companies host testimonial contests where customers would write ~100 words starting with "Why I like [product|brand]..", usually rewarding large prizes to the winner.

#### Public Commitments

> Public commitments tend to be lasting commitments

Public commitments cause a drive within the subject to look consistent. Inconsistency is viewed upon negatively.

A study explained in the book describes subjects who either did/or did not commit to a hypothesis by writing it down -- some did write it, some kept it in their head. Those who publicly committed, by writing it down, were by far least likely to change their stance; those who committed only mentally changed their view far more easily.

#### Initiation

Initiation ceremonies are found in many cultures -- from tribe sin Africa, to fraternities in US colleges. A study by Elliot Aronson and Judson Mills explained that the effect these ceremonies have on participants is a more positive perspective of, and a heightened commitment to, the exclusive group, and a more negative view by those who do not participate in an initiation ceremony. These ceremonies strengthen group bonds.

> Persons who go through a great deal of trouble or pain to attain something tend to value it more highly than persons who attain the same thing with minimum of effort -- Aronson and Mills

The book postulates that these initiations are "acts of group survival":

> The loyalty and dedication of those who emerge will increase to a great degree the chances of group cohesiveness and survival.

### Inner Choice

> It appears that commitments are most effective in changing a person's self-image and future behaviour when they are active, public, and effort-full.

The fourth and most important attribute of an effective commitment is the feeling that it was the subject's choice to do so. Large prizes inhibit this feeling, with smaller prizes emphasising it -- so it's better to go with a smaller prize.

An experiment by Jonathan Friedman showed that among two groups of boys told not to play with a robot, with one group threatened with consequences (yes, he threatened kids) -- both groups did not play with the robot when left alone. However several weeks later, with a different moderator, the boys were left alone to play with the toys without a reminder about the robot -- out of the group that were threatened: 77% of the boys played with the robot, and the group that were not threatened: only 33% played with it. This shows that the boys who exercised an inner choice were significantly more likely to comply, which continued on after the experiment had completed. The key is self perception, the boys believed that they did not want to play with it, as opposed to knowing that they can't (but want to).

When talking about teaching children why lying is wrong:

> The important thing is to use a reason that will initially produce the desired behaviour and will, at the same time, allow a child to take personal responsibility for that behaviour. Thus, the less detectable outside pressure such as a reason contains, the better.

The self image changes that occur with commitments are not just specific to that situation. The effects are also lasting. After the self image change, consistency pressure keeps the new behaviour on track, and it "grows legs" -- inducements will no longer be necessary. It's important to note that this induces a change of thinking within the subject, that's spurs new thinking, that can eventually be self-supporting.

Another anecdote is the car salesman that draws commitment with test drives, document signing, and a deal that's better than competitors. The deal is the revoked at a later date, citing error, and framing the new price as competitive -- plus the car is what they chose after-all. The initial deal offered, then revoked, is referred to as the **lowball technique**, and the revocation can be sweetened by a number of other good reasons that support the deal.

Two studies in the book used the "hidden benefit" of the lowball effect to get subjects to use less energy. The deal was their names would be published in the local newspaper, which was revoked later. The subjects actually increased their commitment even after the revocation, they even saw themselves as conservationists -- furthering support in other areas. This is an example of the effect "growing legs".
