# Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion

## Summary

### 2. Reciprocation

**Reciprocation** is the technique of providing a (solicited/unsolicited) favour with the intent on receiving something you want in return -- typically something larger. It's possible to choose the favour you want in return. How much the initiator is liked has little effect on the likelihood of reciprocation. Refusing a favour can induce a form of reciprocation, in that there is a lack of obligation to reciprocate.

**Reciprocal concession** occurs when an initial offer is made, rejected, and a second, more reasonable offer is accepted -- this leverages the **contrast principle**. This is also known as the reject-then-retreat technique. The larger the initial offer/demand (within reason), the more likely the second offer/demand will be accepted.  This is thought to work because the subject feels some **responsibility** over the concession, and because the subject feels **satisfied** with the outcome.

## Intro

The thousands of persuasive tactics (commonly compliance tactics) the author has encountered boil down to 6 simple categories:

* consistency;
* reciprocation;
* social proof;
* authority;
* liking;
* scarcity.

There is also a seventh category that the author doesn't cover because he thinks it's too obvious to go into extensive descriptions about -- **self interest** -- specifically, that "people want the most and pay the least for their choices".

The author also examines each category for the attribute of people's willingness to say yes without thinking.

## 1. Weapons of Influence

* [Mindmap][ch1-mindmap]

Animals have some "fixed-action patterns" that cause them to trigger some behaviour -- like courtship, or self defence. These fixed-action patters are akin to a tape recorder -- once it's started, it plays out in sequence.

Fixed-action patterns have a **trigger feature** -- like size, shape, noise of a predator or a mate. These can be triggered by imitations (similar objects) like something that resembles a predator, that causes the animal to activate a fixed-action pattern.

Humans have these fixed-action patterns and trigger features too.

> When we ask someone to do us a favour we will be more successful if we provide a reason,

When providing a reason, studies have shown a 94% success rate, as opposed to 60% success rate when no reason is provided, but the success isn't due to the reason, but rather the word "because" -- that's the trigger feature

This has a real reason:

> Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I am in a rush?

This one doesn't:

> Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I have to make copies?

Both of these had a ~94% success rate.

Another example of a trigger feature is price: customers perceive more expensive items as being better, and thus they sell easier -- this is a shortcut people take to evaluating the item's quality.

Humans take shortcuts to evaluating a busy environment, and often use stereotype and rules of thumb to classify things to a few key features. An automatic response often occurs when a trigger feature is encountered -- e.g. coupons that don't actually save you money, but redeemed just as often as coupons that do. We just assume that coupons save you something.

One technique that the book describes anecdotally is a tailor shop owner. A man who pretends to be partially deaf, and during the fitting, when asked for the price of the suit, he would call through to his brother. When the brother replies twice, through lack of hearing, the man would in turn quote an incorrect price to the customer -- half that of what his brother replied. This was an opportunity for the customer, but he was being duped.

The **contrast principle** defines a mechanism alter the perceptions of an object. Example: lifting a lighter object before a heavy object will make the heavier object seem heavier than it actually is. Sales people use this principle by presenting an expensive product before a cheaper product. Not doing so means that when the cheaper object is presented first, this principle will in fact work against you, by making the expensive object seem more expensive. Another example is upselling small add-ons to a large financial purchase, like a car. The small cost for each individual add-on seems like an insignificant burden, but they add up. The trick is to offer them individually, to keep them seemingly small. 
## 2. Reciprocation

> The rule says that we should repay, in kind, what another person has provided us.

The obligation to reciprocate kindness is pervasive in any society -- some more pervasive than others. It is said to form the basis of society with goods and services, and invokes a feeling of indebtedness. It's deeply embedded in our culture, and people are unconsciously taught to reciprocate actions.

A study covered in the book demonstrated that when a favour was done for a subject, they are likely to reciprocate a favour in return -- in the study, the favour was a can of Coke provided by another participant (assistant), the reciprocated behaviour was the subject purchasing raffle tickets. How much the participant liked the assistant is unrelated to how many tickets they bought, those that didn't like the assistant bought just as many as those who did -- reciprocation is **overpowering** in nature. Return favours can also be chosen for the subject, just like the raffle tickets.

It can also be used in an opposite manner, a subject refusing a favour/gift in times of need means that the subject doesn't feel indebted, and free to proceed without a necessity for reciprocation.

The favour/gift does not need to be solicited, because there is an **obligation to receive**. It can be simple in form -- like a gummed, individualised address label in a letter.

People can get wise to this tactic, so don't expect it to work repeatedly, unless the subject actually wants to re-engage

An anecdote in the book describes a situation where the Hare Krishnas flower gifts were being thrown into the bin by the subject, after they received their donation. The flowers were then fished out only to be recycled for the same purpose.

The reciprocation rule implies some zero-sum, even exchange, but often the exchange can be uneven. One reason is the burden of obligation is felt so negatively, it's often the case that a considerably larger favour can be returned. Another reason is that people who don't reciprocate are viewed negatively in social groups.

### Reciprocal Concessions

Another more subtle form of reciprocation is through concessions -- we are likely to reciprocate a concession. The example in the book was a boy scout selling $5 tickets, when the subject refused, the boy scout conceded and offered a $1 chocolate bar instead. The subject felt obligated, and conceded. Sometimes, if a person is being deceptive, the initial offer is actually just a decoy. This is the contrast principle at work.

> Heads I win, tails you lose.

This is known as the **reject-then-retreat** technique.

The larger the initial request, the more successful the second request will be, but only up to a point. If the initial request is too large, the tactic will backfire. It will also backfire if it appears to be a transparent trick.

An anecdote from the book covers the script of a TV show -- some lines were deliberately provocative, knowing that the censors would cut it. Concessions were made to get the lines they actually wanted. The same text demonstrates the technique with the repeated use of a controversial word, hoping it would be cut down to a single use.

Another anecdote describes a door-to-door salesman deliberately getting the sales pitch rejected, only to retreat to a simple concession: getting referrals.

Retailers will demo the top-of-the-line, deluxe model first, then the concession.

Research has shown that that bad reactions are *less* likely to occur than just asking outright.

A Canadian study showed that the reject-then-retreat technique was 76% effective vs 29% effective when a subject was just asked outright. The follow-up (the subjects were asked to do community service) ended up with 85% of the reject-then-retreat subjects showing up, vs only 50% of the subjects that were asked outright. This study has been repeated, where the subjects were also asked to do something extra after they show up, and it showed that the reject-and-retreat subjects are significantly more likely to follow through, and to also volunteer for some other behaviour if asked.


There are two reasons why this technique works:

* **responsibility**: the subject feels that they have some control over the concession -- for example, in a negotiation, a concession, to a counter-negotiator, would feel like they were responsible for the result;
* **satisfaction**: the book describes an experiment, after which, the subjects who were the target for the reject-then-retreat technique recorded more satisfaction with the outcome than the other subjects. Subjects who are satisfied are more likely to engage with further requests.

### Dealing with it

Being the subject is not easy, it's not clear if the initial offer is genuine, or if it's an attempt to exploit you. Sometimes, a gift is just a gift.

One way to deal with it is to just accept the initial favour, and if it turns out to be a compliance device, then don't feel obligated to comply.
