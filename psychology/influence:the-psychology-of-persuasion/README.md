# Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion

## Summary

### 2. Reciprocation

[Mindmap][ch2-mindmap]

**Reciprocation** is the technique of providing a (solicited/unsolicited) favour with the intent on receiving something you want in return -- typically something larger. It's possible to choose the favour you want in return. How much the initiator is liked has little effect on the likelihood of reciprocation. Refusing a favour can induce a form of reciprocation, in that there is a lack of obligation to reciprocate.

**Reciprocal concession** occurs when an initial offer is made, rejected, and a second, more reasonable offer is accepted -- this leverages the **contrast principle**. This is also known as the reject-then-retreat technique. The larger the initial offer/demand (within reason), the more likely the second offer/demand will be accepted.  This is thought to work because the subject feels some **responsibility** over the concession. The subject also feels more **satisfied** with the outcome than those asked outright.

### 3. Commitment and Consistency

[Mindmap][ch3-mindmap]

> If I can get you to make a commitment, I will have set the stage for your automatic and ill considered consistency to that commitment.

Getting an initial **commitment** is called the **foot-in-the-door technique**, and subjects are more likely to be **consistent** with their initial commitments. The initial commitment can be small, and incrementally grown overtime, eventually reaching a very large commitment. Commitments can come in many forms -- asking a favour, a hug, or a purchase etc. The initial commitment doesn't have to be related to the true intention, it can be just a token gesture. 

Generally speaking, a **consistency** is a cognitive shortcut that affords people less effort for managing information and their environment. It's this shortcut that's exploited through solicitation.  Consistency is so strong that sometimes people will follow through with obviously bad decisions to avoid dealing with some difficult reality -- like a debunked solution for a problem that really needs to be solved.

Commitment alters one's self image, and can be effectively achieved through public declarations or writing. One's self image can be changed incrementally, and incentivised with small concessions -- where the smaller the concession, the stronger the belief that the statement was an internalised choice. It's this internalised choice that's important, and studies have shown that it's far more effective than consequences. Commitments to ceremonies for exclusive groups heightens the initiated member's commitment, and strengthens group bonds.

Sometimes commitment and consistency are used in a more insidious way -- promises that must be kept, yet can't be fulfilled, can be leveraged for a larger return; simply asking for a benign statement or answer, only to be leveraged for gain at a later date; getting written commitment, offering a deal, then revoking said deal at a later date -- aka the **lowball technique**.

The end goal of commitment and consistency is to induce a commitment within the subject, changing their self image in the process, and then removing those inducements, and allowing the subject to pursue and grow that self image on their own. The self image changes can be fairly innocuous -- like environment conscientiousness.

### 4. Social Proof

[Mindmap][ch4-mindmap]

> Since 95% of the people are imitators and only 5% initiators, people are persuaded more by the actions of others than by any proof that we can offer -- Cavett Robert

> In general, when we are unsure of ourselves, when the situation is unclear or ambiguous, when uncertainty reigns, we are most likely to look to and accept the actions of others as correct.

* The best leaders know how to arrange group conditions to maximise social acceptance;
* people look to the behaviours of others in times of **uncertainty**, and are mostly affected by those who are **similar** to themselves;
* people will often go against their best judgement to conform to groups (assuming ideal conditions) -- **pluralistic ignorance**;
* social proof can be extremely subtle;
* sometimes following the majority is a good thing, but it makes you vulnerable. Other times it's not a good thing.

Social proof essentially seeks the conformity of subject to the majority (group or individuals), especially in times of **uncertainty**, *particularly* when the group members are **similar** to the subject. Uncertainty causes people to look to the actions of others to determine their own behaviour, and [pluralistic ignorance][pluralistic-ignorance], which plays a key role, is what convinces the subject (particularly when in a group of strangers) to conform, even against their own beliefs (this effect will apply to each member of the group). The greater the degree of social proof, the more convincing it is. Sometimes social proof is sought by those whose beliefs are diminishing, in a desperate attempt to validate them.

Other factors besides *uncertainty* and *similarity* can influence behaviour, for example, [diffusion of responsibility][diffusion-of-responsibility], which reduces the responsibility of each group member and makes them less likely to act.

To combat pluralistic ignorance one has to be direct, clear, and directly assign responsibilities, or to challenge fake or erroneous evidence. Being direct, countering hard, or by refusing to follow others overcomes these effects. It's difficult, because sometimes social proof is very subtle, e.g. betting on a favourite horse. The favourite is defined by the total power of bet purchases, which isn't obvious. Sometimes you don't even realise that you're following the majority -- *that* makes you vulnerable.

### 5. Liking

[Mindmap][ch5-mindmap]

* **be likeable**: likeability increases compliance;
* **use tactics**: physical attractiveness, similarities, compliments (flattery), familiarity (friendships; prior experience), and contrasting positive associations all work to increase likeability of people or products;
* **avoid schisms**: schisms can be created arbitrarily through boundaries and competition;
* **cooperate**: schisms can be remedied with cross group cooperation;

The likeability of a person has a significant impact on the whether the subject will comply with a request. Friends can be used directly, or indirectly, to make subjects comply with a request -- indirectly in this case means non-physical presence, like a referral.

Some factors that affect the likeability:

* **physical attractiveness**: there is an *unconscious* bias towards attractive people, from job interviews, politics, to the judicial system. Attractive people are also seen as more intelligent. The effects are also the same between subjects of the same gender, regardless of sexuality;
* **similarity**: this comes in any form -- demographics, clothing, agendas, even mirroring body language. It's a common tactic for those who want to be liked to somehow appear similar;
* **compliments**: even abundant, transparent, and inaccurate/exaggerated flattery works very well. It can be as subtle as a holiday greeting card;
* **familiarity**: things that you see more, or come into contact with more, are often liked more, which can have a significant influence on decision making (e.g. more persuasive). Dissimilarities have the opposite effect;
* **association**: any positive association works to increase likeability, even if it's unrelated -- celebrities, sports teams, nature, a good meal etc. Although, positive associations are significantly more likely to be made when a negative association was recently experienced -- in order for the subject to restore their image, and associate with something positive. There was no change in positive associations when the subject's recent experiences were positive. The association/disassociation with positive/negative things is unconscious. People care about their image, and often must *feel* superior to the competition. This is often seen with sports team fans, in the form of tribalism. Guilt by association is a real effect too -- blaming the weatherman for the weather for instance.

Schisms can be formed with simple acts such as arbitrarily dividing people into groups, naming said groups, and assigning competing tasks. Schisms can be countered with cross group **cooperation** where groups work towards common, legitimate goals. As a side-effect, this creates **familiarity** and **similarities** (shared values/goals) between them -- it also increases general satisfaction and happiness. Contact between groups that are *not* cooperating, or are *unfamiliar*, can have quite serious consequences -- sometimes violent.  A compliance professional would typically frame themselves as part of the same team as the subject, and foster cooperation -- e.g. good cop / bad cop.

## Intro

The thousands of persuasive tactics (commonly compliance tactics) the author has encountered boil down to 6 simple categories:

* consistency;
* reciprocation;
* social proof;
* authority;
* liking;
* scarcity.

There is also a seventh category that the author doesn't cover because he thinks it's too obvious to go into extensive descriptions about -- **self interest** -- specifically, that "people want the most and pay the least for their choices".

The author also examines each category for the attribute of people's willingness to say yes without thinking.

## 1. Weapons of Influence

[Mindmap][ch1-mindmap]

Animals have some "fixed-action patterns" that cause them to trigger some behaviour -- like courtship, or self defence. These fixed-action patters are akin to a tape recorder -- once it's started, it plays out in sequence.

Fixed-action patterns have a **trigger feature** -- like size, shape, noise of a predator or a mate. These can be triggered by imitations (similar objects) like something that resembles a predator, that causes the animal to activate a fixed-action pattern.

Humans have these fixed-action patterns and trigger features too.

> When we ask someone to do us a favour we will be more successful if we provide a reason,

When providing a reason, studies have shown a 94% success rate, as opposed to 60% success rate when no reason is provided, but the success isn't due to the reason, but rather the word "because" -- that's the trigger feature

This has a real reason:

> Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I am in a rush?

This one doesn't:

> Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I have to make copies?

Both of these had a ~94% success rate.

Another example of a trigger feature is price: customers perceive more expensive items as being better, and thus they sell easier -- this is a shortcut people take to evaluating the item's quality.

Humans take shortcuts to evaluating a busy environment, and often use stereotype and rules of thumb to classify things to a few key features. An automatic response often occurs when a trigger feature is encountered -- e.g. coupons that don't actually save you money, but redeemed just as often as coupons that do. We just assume that coupons save you something.

One technique that the book describes anecdotally is a tailor shop owner. A man who pretends to be partially deaf, and during the fitting, when asked for the price of the suit, he would call through to his brother. When the brother replies twice, through lack of hearing, the man would in turn quote an incorrect price to the customer -- half that of what his brother replied. This was an opportunity for the customer, but he was being duped.

The **contrast principle** defines a mechanism alter the perceptions of an object. Example: lifting a lighter object before a heavy object will make the heavier object seem heavier than it actually is. Sales people use this principle by presenting an expensive product before a cheaper product. Not doing so means that when the cheaper object is presented first, this principle will in fact work against you, by making the expensive object seem more expensive. Another example is upselling small add-ons to a large financial purchase, like a car. The small cost for each individual add-on seems like an insignificant burden, but they add up. The trick is to offer them individually, to keep them seemingly small. 
## 2. Reciprocation

> The rule says that we should repay, in kind, what another person has provided us.

[Mindmap][ch2-mindmap]

The obligation to reciprocate kindness is pervasive in any society -- some more pervasive than others. It is said to form the basis of society with goods and services, and invokes a feeling of indebtedness. It's deeply embedded in our culture, and people are unconsciously taught to reciprocate actions.

A study covered in the book demonstrated that when a favour was done for a subject, they are likely to reciprocate a favour in return -- in the study, the favour was a can of Coke provided by another participant (assistant), the reciprocated behaviour was the subject purchasing raffle tickets. How much the participant liked the assistant is unrelated to how many tickets they bought, those that didn't like the assistant bought just as many as those who did -- reciprocation is **overpowering** in nature. Return favours can also be chosen for the subject, just like the raffle tickets.

It can also be used in an opposite manner, a subject refusing a favour/gift in times of need means that the subject doesn't feel indebted, and free to proceed without a necessity for reciprocation.

The favour/gift does not need to be solicited, because there is an **obligation to receive**. It can be simple in form -- like a gummed, individualised address label in a letter.

People can get wise to this tactic, so don't expect it to work repeatedly, unless the subject actually wants to re-engage

An anecdote in the book describes a situation where the Hare Krishnas flower gifts were being thrown into the bin by the subject, after they received their donation. The flowers were then fished out only to be recycled for the same purpose.

The reciprocation rule implies some zero-sum, even exchange, but often the exchange can be uneven. One reason is the burden of obligation is felt so negatively, it's often the case that a considerably larger favour can be returned. Another reason is that people who don't reciprocate are viewed negatively in social groups.

### Reciprocal Concessions

Another more subtle form of reciprocation is through concessions -- we are likely to reciprocate a concession. The example in the book was a boy scout selling $5 tickets, when the subject refused, the boy scout conceded and offered a $1 chocolate bar instead. The subject felt obligated, and conceded. Sometimes, if a person is being deceptive, the initial offer is actually just a decoy. This is the contrast principle at work.

> Heads I win, tails you lose.

This is known as the **reject-then-retreat** technique.

The larger the initial request, the more successful the second request will be, but only up to a point. If the initial request is too large, the tactic will backfire. It will also backfire if it appears to be a transparent trick.

An anecdote from the book covers the script of a TV show -- some lines were deliberately provocative, knowing that the censors would cut it. Concessions were made to get the lines they actually wanted. The same text demonstrates the technique with the repeated use of a controversial word, hoping it would be cut down to a single use.

Another anecdote describes a door-to-door salesman deliberately getting the sales pitch rejected, only to retreat to a simple concession: getting referrals.

Retailers will demo the top-of-the-line, deluxe model first, then the concession.

Research has shown that that bad reactions are *less* likely to occur than just asking outright.

A Canadian study showed that the reject-then-retreat technique was 76% effective vs 29% effective when a subject was just asked outright. The follow-up (the subjects were asked to do community service) ended up with 85% of the reject-then-retreat subjects showing up, vs only 50% of the subjects that were asked outright. This study has been repeated, where the subjects were also asked to do something extra after they show up, and it showed that the reject-and-retreat subjects are significantly more likely to follow through, and to also volunteer for some other behaviour if asked.


There are two reasons why this technique works:

* **responsibility**: the subject feels that they have some control over the concession -- for example, in a negotiation, a concession, to a counter-negotiator, would feel like they were responsible for the result;
* **satisfaction**: the book describes an experiment, after which, the subjects who were the target for the reject-then-retreat technique recorded more satisfaction with the outcome than the other subjects. Subjects who are satisfied are more likely to engage with further requests.

### Dealing with it

Being the subject is not easy, it's not clear if the initial offer is genuine, or if it's an attempt to exploit you. Sometimes, a gift is just a gift.

One way to deal with it is to just accept the initial favour, and if it turns out to be a compliance device, then don't feel obligated to comply.

## 3. Commitment and Consistency

> Give an inch and take a mile [idiom]

[Mindmap][ch3-mindmap]

The consistency principle describes the need for people to be consistent with previous decisions, thoughts, beliefs etc. even if it is detrimental to their own best interests.

One anecdote in the book describes two experiments, both involving a thief. In the first, a thief steals an object yet nobody intervenes. In the second, the subjects were asked to "watch my things", which yielded significantly more interventions when the thief tried to steal.

Consistency is associated with intellectual strength, logic, rationality, stability. Inconsistency is associated with indecisive, confused, two-faced, and even mentally ill. Good consistency is highly valued.

Consistency is a cognitive shortcut -- it allows people to avoid always having to think about an issue, which can be very taxing.

> There's no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labour of thinking -- Sir Joshua Reynolds

People will often hide behind **walls of consistency** to protect themselves from harsh realities. The anecdote in the book describes an obvious scam, a meditation group promising impossible things, yet after the presenters were challenged, people signed up in droves. Afterwards, it was found out that the subjects had problems that they wanted to believe could be solved. They chose to ignore the challenge because they had already mentally committed, and wanted the decision made before doubt crept in. They were consistent with their initial beliefs.

Toy companies will advertise certain toys prior to Christmas, then under-supply them. They bet on your making promises to your children. For Christmas you will probably have to substitute the toy because it's out of stock, and be true to your promise in January. The consistency principle being leveraged here is the promise made to your children.

### Commitment

Aka the **foot-in-the-door** technique.

> If I can get you to make a commitment, I will have set the stage for your automatic and ill considered consistency to that commitment.

**Commitment strategies** are employed by **compliance professionals** (yes, they actually exist), some of which are described in the book. One such example is a prior commitment to a cancer charity by asking subjects whether they'd commit to helping a cancer charity -- most people said yes. Days later, when asked to do the deed, that commitment yielded a 700% increase in respondents. Another example was simply asking residents if they think they would vote. The commitment was made, and voter turnout increased.

A more subtle commitment technique is to initiate dialogue by asking how the subject is feeling. When they respond positively, this creates a commitment to that general mood. The subjects are twice as likely to receive the solicitation than they are if they had received a simple, friendly initiating comment -- the question draws out the commitment. Furthermore, in the event of a follow-up, say a home visit (e.g. by invitation), it resulted in an 89% success rate for the solicitation (e.g. a sale) -- commitment pressure at work.

The commitment technique can be played out by soliciting an initial, small commitment. Then by incrementally increasing the size of each subsequent commitment.

> Almost any sale will do, because the purpose of that small transaction is not profit. It is commitment.

This technique can be used to eventually get a very large commitment from the subjects -- an anecdote in the book started with a small "drive safely sign", and ended up with a large billboard in the subjects front garden. The anecdotes often start with a commitment that nobody will refuse -- something almost everybody would agree to.

The larger commitment doesn't always need to be related to the initial one either, it really depends on what the subjects are committing to. In response to a experiment where subjects were initially asked to sign a petition, then to erect an unrelated billboard in their garden, Freedman and Fraser said:

> What may occur is the person's feelings about getting involved or taking action. Once he has agreed to an request, his attitude may change, he may become, in his own eyes, the kind of person who does this sort of thing, who agrees to requests made by strangers, who takes action on things he believes in, who cooperates with good causes.

This is really saying that such commitments can alter one's **self image**. Be careful with small, trivial commitments.

#### Written Commitment

People use their own actions to define their own beliefs -- self perception. The simple act of writing a statement can change self perception. Such an act can be forced upon people, and anecdotally, the book explains that POWs of the Korean War were forced to write statements. This was a driver to incrementally change a person's self image, and it was very successful.

Concessions were used (with the writings) to get initial commitments -- highly favourable statements about America, with small concessions leaning towards Communism. This was a small step towards conversion.

The act of writing a statement down has several layers to it: it drives self perception;
it can be shown to other people (who will have a natural tendency to think it's true), convince them, and conversely convince yourself. People respond to what they perceive others think of them. One study found that when subjects were told that they were considered charitable, they gave larger chartable donations.

> What those those around us think is true of us is enormously important in determining what we ourselves think is true

A general, self commitment technique for those trying to achieve a goal:

> Set a goal an write it down

Some companies use a written commitment as a powerful technique to drastically reduce returns -- due to a "cooling off period" that's law in some states in the USA. This written statement usually comes in the form of a sales agreements, filled out by the customer.

Other companies host testimonial contests where customers would write ~100 words starting with "Why I like [product|brand]..", usually rewarding large prizes to the winner.

#### Public Commitments

> Public commitments tend to be lasting commitments

Public commitments cause a drive within the subject to look consistent. Inconsistency is viewed upon negatively.

A study explained in the book describes subjects who either did/or did not commit to a hypothesis by writing it down -- some did write it, some kept it in their head. Those who publicly committed, by writing it down, were by far least likely to change their stance; those who committed only mentally changed their view far more easily.

#### Initiation

Initiation ceremonies are found in many cultures -- from tribe sin Africa, to fraternities in US colleges. A study by Elliot Aronson and Judson Mills explained that the effect these ceremonies have on participants is a more positive perspective of, and a heightened commitment to, the exclusive group, and a more negative view by those who do not participate in an initiation ceremony. These ceremonies strengthen group bonds.

> Persons who go through a great deal of trouble or pain to attain something tend to value it more highly than persons who attain the same thing with minimum of effort -- Aronson and Mills

The book postulates that these initiations are "acts of group survival":

> The loyalty and dedication of those who emerge will increase to a great degree the chances of group cohesiveness and survival.

### Inner Choice

> It appears that commitments are most effective in changing a person's self-image and future behaviour when they are active, public, and effort-full.

The fourth and most important attribute of an effective commitment is the feeling that it was the subject's choice to do so. Large prizes inhibit this feeling, with smaller prizes emphasising it -- so it's better to go with a smaller prize.

An experiment by Jonathan Friedman showed that among two groups of boys told not to play with a robot, with one group threatened with consequences (yes, he threatened kids) -- both groups did not play with the robot when left alone. However several weeks later, with a different moderator, the boys were left alone to play with the toys without a reminder about the robot -- out of the group that were threatened: 77% of the boys played with the robot, and the group that were not threatened: only 33% played with it. This shows that the boys who exercised an inner choice were significantly more likely to comply, which continued on after the experiment had completed. The key is self perception, the boys believed that they did not want to play with it, as opposed to knowing that they can't (but want to).

When talking about teaching children why lying is wrong:

> The important thing is to use a reason that will initially produce the desired behaviour and will, at the same time, allow a child to take personal responsibility for that behaviour. Thus, the less detectable outside pressure such as a reason contains, the better.

The self image changes that occur with commitments are not just specific to that situation. The effects are also lasting. After the self image change, consistency pressure keeps the new behaviour on track, and it "grows legs" -- inducements will no longer be necessary. It's important to note that this induces a change of thinking within the subject, that's spurs new thinking, that can eventually be self-supporting.

Another anecdote is the car salesman that draws commitment with test drives, document signing, and a deal that's better than competitors. The deal is the revoked at a later date, citing error, and framing the new price as competitive -- plus the car is what they chose after-all. The initial deal offered, then revoked, is referred to as the **lowball technique**, and the revocation can be sweetened by a number of other good reasons that support the deal.

Two studies in the book used the "hidden benefit" of the lowball effect to get subjects to use less energy. The deal was their names would be published in the local newspaper, which was revoked later. The subjects actually increased their commitment even after the revocation, they even saw themselves as conservationists -- furthering support in other areas. This is an example of the effect "growing legs".

> It is this tendency to be automatically and unthinkingly consistent that we must be wary of [paraphrased]

### 4. Social Proof

[Mindmap][ch4-mindmap]

Experiments have shown that canned laughter causes audiences to laugh more, longer, and to rate a show as funnier. Some evidence indicates that it works best on poor jokes. This can come in the form of demonstrations, to coerce behaviour -- an example is marketing videos, where people similar to the demographics vouch for, or are observed using, the product. The perception that other people are doing something, when you are uncertain about the situation, can come across as the right thing to do. Often-times scams use paid fanatics 

Social proof is perceived as:

> Usually, when a lot of people are doing something, it is the right thing to do.

Why it exists:

> Like the other weapons of influence, it provides a convenient shortcut for determining how to behave but, at the same time, makes one who uses the shortcut vulnerable.

Social proof can come in the form of partially fake, or completely fake evidence. Bartenders often "salt" their tip jars -- initially filling it with some change. Fake audience members are often used to game or encourage reactions from other audience members. Phrases like "fastest growing" and "largest selling" are often used in copywriting. Night club owners sometimes employ queues of people. Charity events that spend most of their time emphasising how much other people have donated. Sales pitches that provide testimonies of other purchasers.

> Since 95% of the people are imitators and only 5% initiators, people are persuaded more by the actions of others than by any proof that we can offer -- Cavett Robert

One experiment by Albert Bandura showed that children with a fear of dogs were 67% likely to interact closely with dogs after spending four days watching other children playing with them. This effect didn't dissipate either, it grew stronger over time without intervention. A second study showed that this same effect can be achieved through videos, and the most effective videos were ones that showed a lots of children interacting with dogs.

> Apparently the principle of social proof works best when the proof is provided by the actions of a lot of other people. 

This same method of using videos also worked on children who were showing symptoms of social isolation. It was so successful that some of the children later became social leaders within their schools.

An interesting anecdote in the book, about a cult and their day of reckoning, explained how a group further convinced themselves after being ultimately proven wrong -- their day of reckoning (the end of the world) didn't come. These people had dedicated so much, that in utter disbelief and cornered, they sought any way to reconcile their diminishing beliefs. It came in the form of social proof -- recruitment, and contacting media. 

> If they could spread the word, if they could inform the uninformed, if they could persuade the sceptics, and if, by doing so, they could win new converts, their threatened but treasured beliefs could become *truer*.

[**Pluralistic ignorance**][pluralistic-ignorance] is the phenomenon where multiple group members conform to group opinion, even though they think it's wrong.

> Pluralistic ignorance is a situation where a majority of group members privately reject a norm, but go along with it because they assume, incorrectly, that most others accept it.  This is also described as "no-one believes, but everyone thinks that everyone believes". [\[source\]][pluralistic-ignorance]

It was [pluralistic ignorance][pluralistic-ignorance], that caused the group to ignore  the obvious evidence that they had been duped, and to seek social validation from others to further justify their commitment. This sounds a lot like the "walls of consistency".

Social proof works best with uncertainty:

> In general, when we are unsure of ourselves, when the situation is unclear or ambiguous, when uncertainty reigns, we are most likely to look to and accept the actions of others as correct.

The book states two reasons for the **bystander effect**:

1. with several people looking on, each person's responsibility is reduced;
1. with a number of people present, and an uncertainty with what's going on, each person is looking around at everyone else to see their reactions -- social proof.

The book describes an experiment where a research assistant (posing as a person having an epileptic fit) received help 85% of the time when there was a single bystander, and only 31% of the time when there was five.

Another experiment is described where smoke was deliberately seeped under a door: 75% of lone individuals reported it; 38% reported it in a three person group; only 10% reported it when two of a three person group were coached to not react.

A similar study showed that a lone bystander provided emergency aid 90% of the time, while only 16% of the time when in the presence of two passive bystanders.

> It seems that the pluralistic ignorance effect is strongest among strangers.

The bystander effect appears to occur when there is uncertainty about the situation, especially in the company of strangers. However, when the situation is very clear, aid is rendered 90-100% of the time, regardless if the bystander is alone or in a group.

Cities appear to have apt conditions for the bystander effect: a fast and uncertain environment; generally more groups; people know each other less.

#### Overcome

The enemy is uncertainty. Being embarrassed for being in the wrong or looking foolish are why people stand around looking at each other. For people to overcome that -- uncertainty must be removed. Being direct and clear removes doubt. If you must, pick out an individual and assign a responsibility directly -- this avoids [pluralistic ignorance][pluralistic-ignorance]. Take control, and remove all doubt.

#### Similarity

> Without question, when people are uncertain, they are more likely to use others' actions to decide how they themselves should act

Another factor that greatly facilitates social proof is **similarity**:

> We are more inclined to follow the lead of similar individual than dissimilar one.

An experiment carried out by Columbia University tested to see if a dropped wallet, with money and a letter inside of it, would be returned based on similarities with the subject (finder). The letter was written by either a similar, or dissimilar person to the subject, and actually describes a prior attempt to return the wallet. The results found that dissimilarities resulted in only 33% return rate, and similarities resulted in 70%. This experiment tested **social proof** and the effectiveness of similarities.

> We will use the actions of others to decide on proper behaviours for ourselves, especially when we view those others as similar to ourselves.

Other experiments found that anti-smoking and pro-dental messages resonated more effectively, and had lasting effects, when they were demonstrated by peers -- children of the same age.

An interesting example of social proof is the [Werther effect][werther-effect]. This is the imitation of highly publicised suicides. The effect appears in copycat form, where the demographics of the victims in the reports resonate with vulnerable people with the same demographics, causing them to commit suicide. Behavioural attributes are also a factor, those who commit suicide in groups, caused an increase of group suicides -- for example, a pilot of a plane -- or suicide alone, caused an increase of individual suicides. This phenomenon is not limited to suicides, publicised homicides caused an increase of homicides, and publicised heavyweight championship fights also caused an increase of homicides. Interestingly, the race of the loser in the bout correlated to the race of the (increased) homicide victims.

The Jonestown suicides were driven by social proof. The **uncertainty** of a move to the Amazon, and the exclusive **similarity** between the victims and their situation facilitated acceptance -- people looked to the actions of others to guide their own behaviours, [pluralistic ignorance][pluralistic-ignorance] likely took over. This social proof was initiated by some of the more fanatical, obedient followers -- something found in strong-leader dominated groups, whether legitimate or engineered.

> A forceful leader can reasonably expect, however, to persuade some sizeable proportion of group members. Then the raw information that a substantial number of group members has been convinced can, by itself, convince the rest. Thus the most influential leaders are those who know how to arrange group conditions to allow the principle of social proof to work maximally in their favour.

#### Overcome

> Most of the time, we don't want to guard against the information that social proof provides. The evidence it offers about how we should act is usually valid and valuable.

Ignoring a human behaviour that is valuable is hard to do. Exploits for social proof are presented initially in the form of erroneous or manipulated (fake) data. The best defence is to recognise when the data is wrong, and to even aggressively counter-attack -- call it out; don't automatically copy.

An example in the book describing deliberately faked data was instances of companies hiring actors for fake testimonies (as opposed to real people; real testimonies) -- aka **consumers from Mars**, and states that it is obvious to the subject that this is staged.

An example of genuinely erroneous social proof explained in the book was that sometimes, cars will indicate in traffic jams and pull out, this leads other drivers to assume that there is something to avoid, like a traffic accident, and so many other drivers will do the same. This led to accidents. At the very least, without the assumption, people are just following other people's lead.

#### Reader's Example

One example written by a reader was that of betting odds. The odds of a horse are calculated through the number of people betting on a horse, and the amount being bet. Someone who is willing to manipulate the situation would put a large bet on an outside odds horse, pushing it up the odds table towards the favourite. Other betters will generally go for the favourite. All these bets on an inferior horse causes the horse with real prospects down the table, and increase of odds. The malicious person will then place a bet on the superior horse. The social proof lies in the favourite horse -- if everyone else thinks it's the favourite, then it must be, right?

### 5. Liking

[Mindmap][ch5-mindmap]

When describing a Tupperware party that uses social proof, reciprocation, and liking principles:

> The Tupperware Home Parties Corporation arranges for its customers to buy from and for a friend rather than an unknown salesperson. In this way, the attraction, the warmth, the security, and the obligation of friendship are brought to bear on the sales setting.
> The strength of that social bond is twice as likely to determine product purchase as is preference for the product itself.

Even subjects that are aware of the social pressures feel obligated, and usually commit. 

Subjects also do not necessarily need to be present, just a mention of their name is enough. One *very* effective technique that is described in the book -- called the "endless chain", is used by door-to-door salesmen. Once a prospect has admitted to liking a product they can be pressed for referrals. When a referral is visited, the referee is mentioned.

Joe Girard's two basic rules for selling:

> A fair price, and someone they liked to buy from.

#### Physical Attractiveness

> A study of the Canadian federal elections found that attractive candidates received more two and a half times as many votes as unattractive candidates.
> Follow-up research demonstrated that voters do not realise their bias. In fact 73% of Canadian voters surveyed denied in the strongest possible terms that their votes had been influenced by physical appearance; only 14% even allowed for the possibility of such influence.

Another study showed that good grooming of applicants weighed more importantly than qualifications in a simulated interview environment, even though the interviewers claimed that it only played a small role.

A study into the judicial found that attractive men received smaller sentences, and were twice as likely to avoid jail. Better looking defendants also paid less compensation.

Better looking people are more likely to receive help when in need, and to persuade audiences.

These effects work both ways, for both sexes, and works even for same sex -- e.g. attractive women receiving more help from women and men alike.

Attractive people are also seen as more intelligent.

#### Similarity

> Those who wish to be liked in order to increase our compliance can accomplish that purpose by appearing similar to us in any of a wide variety of ways

Dress is one way that can be leveraged to be similar to subjects. One of the studies mentioned stated that anti-war protestors were more likely to sign a petition, even without reading it, if the requester was dressed like them.

Background similarities also work -- hobbies, experiences etc. so do things like age, religion, politics, and smoking habits.

> Many sales training programs now urge trainees to "mirror and match" the customer's body posture, mood, and verbal style.

#### Compliments

The knowledge of someone liking you can lead to reciprocation, and can be a very effective compliance technique. Flattery and claims of affinity are common tricks.

A technique used by Joe Girard was to send all of his former customers a holiday greeting card, each month, with just his name on it.

> We are phenomenal suckers for flattery

> Although there are limits to our gullibility -- especially when we can be sure that the flatterer is trying to manipulate us -- we tend, as a rule, to believe praise and to like those who provide it, often-times when it is clearly false.

An experiment in the book found a few things about flattery:

* those who provided only praise were liked the most;
* it doesn't matter if the provider of the flattery stands to gain, they are liked anyway;
* they do not have to be accurate -- untrue (flattery) statements are just as effective as true statements

> Apparently we have such an automatically positive reaction to compliments that we can fall victim to someone who uses them in an obvious attempt to win out favour.

#### Familiarity, Contact, and Cooperation

> For the most part, we like things that are familiar to us.

One experiment covered in the book describes the unconscious nature of familiarity. Subjects were exposed to faces that were quickly flashed on the screen, faces that they were unfamiliar with. The experiment found that the more frequently a face was flashed on screen, the more the subjects liked that person. Furthermore, the subjects were more easily persuaded by the opinions of these now familiar individuals.

The book describes a relationship between ethnic friendship boundaries and competition in schools, as one factor with racial tensions. Generally, kids/people will foster friendships within their own racial communities. It's also the case that within classrooms, a divide between children that achieve and those that do not, fosters resentment, and jealousy between students -- who are all competing for the attention of the authority, the teacher. Familiarity between friends, who are generally ethically similar, creates a liking, and seems to alleviate negative feeling. Dissimilarities between people, generally of different ethnic backgrounds, is exacerbated through the competition -- resentment and jealousy.

> Although the familiarity produced by contact usually leads to greater liking, the opposite occurs if the contact carries distasteful experiences with it.

Another example was of a boys' summer camp, where the only thing that was necessary to create resentment was to separate the boys into two groups. Things that further created resentment were giving each group a name, and having them engage in competing group activities. The results were quite severe -- scuffles, thefts etc. The resolution to these divisions was cooperation, cooperation that was in the best interests of both groups -- a stuck vehicle; pooling money for resources; water shortage etc. The results were significant, many of the boys now had cross-group best friends.

One solution to divisions in schools that worked was the Jigsaw classroom -- essentially cooperative learning. The class was divided into groups, and each groups was responsible for a subset of a larger problem. In order to complete the task, not only did each group have to work together, but groups had to work together too. This had some positive results ranging from improved performance, happiness, and satisfaction with school.

Competition has its place too, it's thought that the goal of such cooperative learning shouldn't remove all competition, but only its monopoly.

> Compliance professionals are forever attempting to establish that we and they are working for the same goals, that we must "pull together" for mutual benefit, that they are, in essence, teammates.

Good cop/bad cop works because the good cop is on your side.

#### Conditioning and Association

This chapter starts out with an anecdote that describes how a weatherman is often-times blamed for bad weather -- to the point of threats.

> There is a natural human tendency to dislike a person who brings us unpleasant information, even when that person did not cause the bad news.

Aka "guilt by association".

> The principle of association is a general one, governing both negative and positive connections. An innocent association with either bad things or good things will influence how people feel about us.

Compliance professionals are always trying to associate themselves or their products to things that we like. This is why attractive models are often-times used to sell products. Other examples are the Apollo program, nature, celebrities, athletes.

> The important thing for the advertisers to establish the connection; it doesn't have to be a logical one, just a positive one.

Politicians do it with associations to celebrities, or positive policies. Positivity can be associated during a good meal, with silverware, and a good environment -- aka the **luncheon technique**.

Other more subtle cases are customers at a Tupperware party playing Bingo, shouting "Tupperware" if they get a Bingo; radio stations playing their call-letters before big hits etc.

We unconsciously avoid associating ourselves with negative things. One experiment in Georgia showed that students telling other students that they have a phone call (with good or bad news), avoided saying "you have a phone call with some *bad* news", but will say "you have a phone call with some *good* news".

People often have strong associations to sports teams. The outcome of the sports team reflects on your -- it's associated with you, and you to it. It can lead to uncontrollable, ferocious, or strange behaviour.

> All things being equal , you root for your own sex, your own culture, your own locality... and what you want to prove is that *you* are better than the other person. Whomever you root for represents *you*; and when he wins, you win -- Isaac Asimov

We want to prove out superiority to ourselves and to other people.

> If we can surround ourselves with success that we are connected with in even a superficial way, our public prestige will rise.

Such associations can be achieved through wearing clothing (team shirt), and are typically demonstrations that follow crushing wins -- superiority -- as opposed to close games, or defeat. Conversely, fans will attempt to disassociate themselves from crushing defeat -- one anecdote described fans showing up to games with paper bags over their faces when their team had a terrible season.

"We" and "they" are used in positive/negative scenarios. Teams that win, students of an experiment that supported the winners used "we" to describe their team more -- "we won" etc. Students whose team lost used "they" more often -- "they lost" etc.

An experiment described in the book showed that students were more likely to associate themselves to something positive if they had recently had some negative results elsewhere. It also showed there was no discernible effect for students who had a positive result. The experiment measured the use of "we" and "they" for students who either passed/failed a test, and were asked to describe the results of their local sports team.

> It is not when we have a strong feeling of recognized personal accomplishment that we will seek to bask in reflected glory. Instead, it will be when the prestige (both public and private) is low that we will be intent upon using the success of associated others to help restore image,
