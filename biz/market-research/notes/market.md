# Market

> **Market matters most** [\[source\]][gtsp4]

## Caveats

* You can still screw up in a great market, and that has been done many times [\[source\]][gtsp4]
* I wouldn't count on your product creating a new market [\[source\]][gtsp4]
* not reaching a product/market fit means failure [\[source\]][gtsp4]

## Market Research

* Market size
  * the size of the market is the number and growth rate of users [\[source\]][forbes-dms]
  * determine the market size via credible resources [\[source\]][forbes-dms]
    * use common sense - who is an authoritative figure who can provide some generalised stats that you can use to extrapolate for your own needs
    * find whitepapers, or research papers in the same field - they can provide data and indicate sources
    * census and labour bureau, associations within the industry [\[source\]][forbes-dms]
  * calculate how much revenue the market made [\[source\]][forbes-dms]
  * include total sales of you and competitors  [\[source\]][forbes-dms]
  * for presentation use a pitch deck template [\[source\]][forbes-dms]
    * [Peter Thiel's pitch deck][thiel-pitch]  
    * [Cabify's pitch deck][cabify-pitch]
* Surveys [\[source\]][gtmr]
  * has panelists (sources users on their own network, and you can pick demographics) 
    * aytm: not free, expensive for small startup
    * Google surveys: free up to 500 responses, but must be embedded on a website
  * no panelists
    * surveymonkey
    * Google forms;
  * You can source related email addresses from a mailing list, or a marketing agency
  * questions
    * keep them simple, and short [\[source\]][gtmr]
    * you can survey demographics - including income [\[source\]][gtmr]
    * ask about similar products [\[source\]][gtmr]
    * you can be direct - "would you be interested in a product that does..." [\[source\]][gtmr]
* Focus groups [\[source\]][gtmr]
* Keyword Research [\[source\]][gtmr]
    * wordtracker.com: good, shows actual numbers [\[source\]][ssokr]
    * Google trends [\[source\]][ssokr]
    * Google Adwords keyword planner [\[source\]][ssokr]
    * bing ads intelligence (MS excel onlue) [\[source\]][ssokr]
    * ... more
  * brainstorm lots of potential keywords - leave no stone unturned [\[source\]][ssokr]
  * keyword competition describes how hard it will be to rank on that keyword [\[source\]][ssokr]
  * test chosen keywords - see what pops up [\[source\]][ssokr]
* Competitor research
  * find their websites, social media, advertisement channels etc. [\[source\]][gtmr]
  * look at the quality and quantity of products/services, prices, area coverage, brand reputation, customer reviews - if you think you can beat them, go for it [\[source\]][gtmr]
  * what has and hasn't worked for your competition is invaluable - it's like they have done the market research for you. This allows you to differentiate, and improve the offering [\[source\]][gtmr]

## Justification

* in a great market -- a market with lots of potential customers -- the market pulls the product out of the startup [\[source\]][gtsp4]
* the market need to be fulfilled, and the market *will* be fulfilled by the first viable product that comes along [\[source\]][gtsp4]
* the product doesn't need to be great; it just basically has to work [\[source\]][gtsp4]
* when you have a great market, the team is remarkably easy to upgrade on the fly [\[source\]][gtsp4]
* in a terrible market, you can have the best team and product and you will still fail [\[source\]][gtsp4]
* you will succeed with an adequate team, adequate product, and a great market [\[source\]][gtsp4]
* even starups that make a lot of mistakes can make it in a good market [\[source\]][gtsp4]

## Product/Market Fit

> **"Being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market"** [\[source\]][gtsp4] 

> "Lots of products fail before a product/market fit ever happens" [\[source\]][gtsp4]

* how do you know if your product fits the market?
  * customers are buying your product as fast as you can make it, or usage growth is just as fast as you can add more servers [\[source\]][trpmf]
  * money is piling up in your company's account [\[source\]][trpmf]
  * you're hiring sales and support staff as fast as you can [\[source\]][trpmf]
  * until your team is frantically trying to deal with the influx of demand, stay lean, burn low, and be effective and efficient [\[source\]][trpmf]
* which problem?
  * focus on the market first [\[source\]][trpmf]
  * focus on the problem, not just the solution [\[source\]][trpmf]
  * choose the right problem to solve [\[source\]][trpmf]
  * find problems that are so dire that users are willing to try half-baked, v1, imperfect solutions [\[source\]][trpmf]
* signs of a bad fit
  * customers aren't getting value [\[source\]][gtsp4]
  * word of mount isn't spreading [\[source\]][gtsp4]
  * usage isn't growing that fast [\[source\]][gtsp4]
  * press reviews are not very positive [\[source\]][gtsp4]
  * the sales cycle takes too long [\[source\]][gtsp4]
  * lots of deals never close [\[source\]][gtsp4]
* you reach a product market fit by launching, getting feedback, and iterating [\[source\]][trpmf]
* starting out 
  * launch quickly [\[source\]][trpmf]
  * build MVPs in a good market [\[source\]][trpmf]
    * which will get initial users through the door [\[source\]][trpmf]
* small companies have an advantage - they can move fast, have better customer support, and less is expected of them [\[source\]][trpmf]
* do whatever is required to get there [\[source\]][gtsp4]
  * changing out people [\[source\]][gtsp4]
  * rewriting your product [\[source\]][gtsp4]
  * moving into a different market [\[source\]][gtsp4]
  * telling customers no when you don't want to [\[source\]][gtsp4]
    * also telling them yes when you don't want to [\[source\]][gtsp4]
  * getting multiple rounds of venture capital  [\[source\]][gtsp4]

## Advertising

* Use *popular* social media influencers - even something like "will it blend" on YouTube [\[source\]][strat-boost]
  * video marketing in general [\[source\]][strat-boost]
* Google shopping apparently has a better ROI than Facebook ADs  [\[source\]][strat-boost]
* mailing lists
  * optinmonster: a tool for building mailing lists etc. [\[source\]][conversion-feedback]
  * very useful - can increase sales by 50% [\[source\]][conversion-feedback]
