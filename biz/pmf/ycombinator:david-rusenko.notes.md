# David Rusenko - How to Find Product-Market Fit

* What PMF [looks like][1]
  * The graph is a measure of daily metrics of total users (not user retention)
  * The graph slopes down without PMF, and slopes up with PMF
* [Start with an idea][2]
  * [personal] Not necessarily an idea *born* from data collection
* [Phases of a startup][3]
  * Phase 1-4.5 is PMF search, 4.5 onwards is PMF
  * PMF search is probably the thing kills the most companies [\[4\]][4]
  * Continue to focus and refine PMF in stages >4.5, don't just focus on monetisation and growth
  * Phases
    1. Idea
    1. Prototype
    1. Launch
    1. Traction
      * Product-market fit achieved
    1. Monetisation
    1. Growth
* [The hardest things @ a startup][6]
  1. Finding PMF -- most companies don't make it
  1. Hiring a world-class team -- it's very unintuitiveA
  1. Making money -- Although PMF and hiring a teams is much, much harder
  1. Repeatedly launch great products, in a scalable way
* [The best companies create their own market][7] -- market research won't help here, which is research on existing markets
  * Find a hidden need
    * If it was obvious, everyone would be doing it
    * Everyone is going to tell you that your idea is dumb -- because, if it's obvious everyone would be doing it..
    * Understand what people are trying to do -- "people aren't trying to make a website, they are trying to launch and grow their business"
      * Think of all the substitutes -- website to launch a business: website, facebook page etc..
  * Where are you being pulled -- how is your product being used in unintended ways, or what people want your product to do
    * Saying "that's not what out product does" is not a smart thing to do
  * Initially your product may feel like it fits into an existing market, but over time it enables new markets to create, and ends up creating something much bigger -- like the iphone, which was competing against a small smartphone market, ended up creating an entirely new market, with a device that ended up having a lot more features, and a larger market 
* [Don't listen to people's proposed solutions, listen to their problems][8]
* [Prototype with throwaway code][9] -- focus on fast iterations
* [Don't worry about scalable code][10], millions of users aren't going to beat down your door initially, scaling can come later
* [Expect iterations to take 10x longer][11]
  * Keep your cash burn low
  * Build a team that can do this quickly
* [Test solutions with customers][12]
  * Be flexible with your target customer, if a number of customers that show up are not your target customer, but are hacking and doing interesting things with your product, change your target
  * don't overthink it, anecdotal is okay. Don't get bogged down with being perfect, just iterate fast, and get something in front of customers as fast as possible
    * don't over analyse -- perfect strategy, market research
    * talk to customers -- maybe about an hour
    * UX testing session - you only need about 305 of these
    * metrics
      * you will always have problems with sample size, and statistical significance
      * track the right metrics
      * be very careful with metrics that do not have statistical significance
  * UX testing
    * 3-5 sessions for most critical issues
    * Get someone to use the product in front of you, in person
    * Encourage them to be honest
    * Ask them to perform a task -- do NOT interfere
    * Do not say anything -- watch them struggle
    * People don't read
* [Launch when your product is better than what's out there][13]
* [Prioritising][14]
  * focus only on the one thing that gets you to the next (startup) phase -- aka milestone
    * i.e. eat, sleep, and shoehorn your current focus - don't procrastinate, or deviate
  * optimise for learning
    * typically you'd have a cost to benefit priority list in a spreadsheet
    * although, you can reorganise your priority list that weighs priorities against the "need-to-know/learn" things about your business
* [How do I know when I have achieved PMF][15]
  * Metrics
    * User retention for days 1,3,7, and 30 -- aka returning users
    * [NPS][16]: Net Promoter Score -- A metric from a simple question: "How likely are you to recommend [brand|product] to friends of colleagues?"
      * 9-10: Promoters -- would recommend
      * 7-8: Passives -- meh, vulnerable to competition
      * 0-6: Detractors -- unhappy, can damage brand, impede growth, negative word-of-mouth
      * NPS = % promoters - % detractors
        * if >50% you have PMF
        * example
          * 88% of people answer 9-10, would recommend
          * 8% of people answer 0-6, unhappy
          * 88-8 = 80
        * NPS can be negative, and that's probably where it will start
    * Paying customer renewal rate
      * Churn = churned customers  / total customers
        * not cohort based
        * easier to calculate
        * can be deceiving -- makes accelerating growth look lower than it is, amongst other things
      * Renewal rate
        * % of eligible subscriptions who actually renew -- cohort based
        * A more reliable metric
    * Sign-ups
      * don't pay too much attention to this
    * Conversion rate
      * Don't pay too much attention to this in the beginning
      * You will require this for SaaS 
  * The customers will be beating a path to your door, until then it will feel like an uphill struggle -- pushing your customers towards the solution, who are too nice to tell you no
* [Beyond PMF][17]
  * Three key things a startup must do
    * Your product must be *meaningful* better than alternatives
    * Acquire customers in a differentiated way that scales
    * Invent your business model without killing your traction
  * Beyond $100m valuation
    * Product-market-channel-model Fit [\[18\]][18] [\[19\]][19]
      * really for $100m+ companies
      * channel: how you acquire customers (growth)
      * model: how you make money
        * maybe you charge too much, too little etc..
          * example: where you charge too little, but can't afford a sales team, and too much that no-one will just flat out pay for it
  * Scaling the team [\[20\]][20]
    * Don't scale the team beyond ~20 until you have PMF
      * 23-25 is perfect, beyond that you have to implement your first layer of management
      * Having a layer of management is not good for PMF
      * Because you should be involved in everything customer/product/market/channels
        * fast and high quality decisions
        * after scaling all this knowledge is distributed between lots of people, which makes it much harder
    * Once you have achieved PMF
      * Scale aggressively
        * But don't more than double in any given year - make sure the foundations are solid
        * a lot more delegation, no more micromanagement
      * Be #1, this new market is a race
* Building a brand [\[21\]][21]
  * Don't focus too much on it early on
  * great brands are built on a core consumer insight -- ideally the same one your product is built upon
    * [personal] In other words the problem your product solves, how well it solves it, and how your customer is with the solution
      * Understand that insight early on, and build it into all of your communication and marketing
    * example: Virgin Airlines
      * Research showed there's four reasons people choose an airline: price, routes, schedule, frequent flier programs -- hard to compete on those
      * They focused on UX (the insight) - the flying experience, making it only slightly more expensive
      * This insight was infused in their product, and their marketing

## Q&A

*  What motivated them to find PMF after 18 moths of trying? [\[22\]][22]
  * Young and stupid 
  * Entrepreneurs
    * Determined
      * You only fail when you give up 
      * Avoid sunk cost fallacy
      * If it's something people need, continue to work on it
    * Optimists
      * They don't see risks where other people do
      * Risks are calculated
* Focus on a horizontal (niche) or vertical market? [\[23\]][23]
  * It's generally good advice to focus on a vertical
  * In some cases, focusing on a horizontal market is necessary if your product needs to provide a number of related services
* When creating a market, what changed peoples minds to believing they need what you were offering? [\[24\]][24]
  * The first 3-4 years get some press, convincing people that they can do/need what you're offering 
  * AirBnB had this issue
* When to start fundraising? [\[25\]][25]
  * Most companies will not be able to raise money until the early traction phase
  * How do you get to early traction without funding?
    * Effectively "sweat equity" and burn low.
    * Everyone solves it differently
* Launch when you have something that better than what's out there?
  * No
    * [personal] I disagree
  * Don't look at your product as a feature checklist, because you will always be behind
  * If you are looking at what your competitors are doing, because then you will be inherently following them. Whatever they have launched, they started working on three months before that
  * There may be on feature that people are just killing for, that's going to make up for the lack of the rest
