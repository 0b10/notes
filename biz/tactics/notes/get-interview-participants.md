Tactics for attaining participant for initial customer discovery interviews.

### Technique

1. Distil target customer and hypothesis into a single sentence
  * A single sentence of who they are and what they need
1. Who is this person, and where are they likely to be?
  * Brainstorm - where they are, where/how to collect contact info etc.
  * See "sourcing more customers" section
1. Approach customer, try different personality types

### Personality

The hungriest -- people who want their problem to be solved

* A person who has a problem -- that fits your criteria
* Recognises that they have a problem -- has expressed frustration
* Has the ability to solve it -- has money to spend
* Has attempted to solve it -- has actually tried something

The polar opposite

1. Create a traits continuum
  * Define your target -- tech savvy
  * Define the opposite -- not tech savvy
  * Define several on the same continuum, on both sides - to the extreme
2. People on one extreme may try just about anything

### Sourcing More Customers

1. Define a customer continuum
1. Identify who would be great to talk to -- a persona
1. Approach with a set of question, aimed at gathering how they currently solve their problem -- determine where to start looking

### Email Pitch

* Test the email template one one or two people first

### Sources

* Linkedin
* Quora
* Mailing lists - easy source of emails
* Forums - just asking is seen as quite negative, build some credibility first
