## Psychology

### Foot in the Door Technique

Have the customer make a small commitment, then you can grow your requirements [\[source\]][1]
  * example: ask a shopkeeper to place a small sign in the window, then the next week you can ask if you can make the sign slightly larger [\[source\]][1]

### Door in the Face Technique

Make the customer "slam the door in your face" multiple times, with offers that they *will* refuse. This makes the customer more likely to accept a more reasonable offer. This contrasts the foot-in-the-door technique, which starts small and works up to larger requests. [\[source\]][door-in-the-face]

### Low-ball Technique

From a buyer's perspective, it involves making a lower than expected offer, in the hopes the seller will lower their price.

From a seller's perspective, it involves offering a product at a lower price, in the hopes of up-selling more expensive offerings. The buyer won't back out because of the good initial deal, and because the add-ons are optional -- this is how they justify the purchase to themself, which leverages cognitive dissonance. [\[source\]][low-ball]

### Ambit Claim

This is closely related to the low-ball technique, and contrasts it. An ambit claim is where a demand made is over-and-above expected counter offers. [\[source\]][low-ball]

### Framing Effect

How messages are framed will affect how people react to them:

* positive: 33% chance of saving all lives, 66% possibility of saving no-one;
* negative: 33% chance that no-one will die, 66% probability that everyone will die.

Other examples:

* negative framing (leveraging risk adversity): 93% of PHD students registered early when there was a penalty for late registrations, whereas 67% of PHD students registered early when there was a discount for doing so;
* positive framing: more people will support an economic policy if the employment rate is emphasised, rather than the unemployment rate;
* positive framing: 75% lean meat vs. 25% fat

The effect tends tends to favour a "sure option" in a gain frame, and a risky option in a loss frame -- people are likely to gravitate towards risk when there's a potential loss, but towards a gain frame when it's a certainty.

This effect is more prevalent in children. Young adults are risk takers when presented with a loss frame, and also more likely to respond to positive frames too. Older adults are more likely to make decisions based on immediate gains or losses, and are more susceptible to framing and bias.

This effect defies logic: extensionality. An extensionality violation means two different but logically identical expressions have different outcomes. This is a very prevalent bias with decision making, but curiously only within a person's native language.

### Ambiguous/Subtle Manipulation and Word Play

By now you might be asking...
By now you might be wondering...
By now you could getting...

BUY NOW! [\[source\]][1]

### Commitment Consistency

People don't like to admit that they have changed their mind [\[source\]][1]
  * if a customer has already committed to believing that something is cheap, or of real value, they may be less willing to change their mind about it [\[source\]][1]
### Scarcity

* in stock, time (time left etc.) [\[source\]][1] 
* FOMO [\[source\]][1]

### Success Stories

* leaders, authorities, people who have had success or are happy with your product

### Conformity

* Evidence of a number of people who have already "done it" [\[source\]][1]

### Emotion and Logic

Put the two together
  * empathy, suffering, experience etc. [\[source\]][1]
  * we all believe that we are smarter than we are [\[source\]][1]
Appeal to their emotion [\[source\]][1] [\[source\]][pathos]
  * appeal to logic - use facts and figures - e.g. turn £300 into £300,000 [\[source\]][1]
  * ethos - appeal to the customers values - specifically what they believe about themselves [\[source\]][1]
