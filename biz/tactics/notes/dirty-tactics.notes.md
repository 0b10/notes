## Psychology

### Foot in the Door Technique

Have the customer make a small commitment, then you can grow your requirements [\[1\]][1]
  * example: ask a shopkeeper to place a small sign in the window, then the next week you can ask if you can make the sign slightly larger [\[1\]][1]

### Door in the Face Technique

Make the customer "slam the door in your face" multiple times, with offers that they *will* refuse. This makes the customer more likely to accept a more reasonable offer. This contrasts the foot-in-the-door technique, which starts small and works up to larger requests. [\[3\]][3]

### Low-ball Technique

From a buyer's perspective, it involves making a lower than expected offer, in the hopes the seller will lower their price.

From a seller's perspective, it involves offering a product at a lower price, in the hopes of up-selling more expensive offerings. The buyer won't back out because of the good initial deal, and because the add-ons are optional -- this is how they justify the purchase to themself, which leverages cognitive dissonance. [\[4\]][low-ball]

### Ambiguous/Subtle Manipulation and Word Play

By now you might be asking...
By now you might be wondering...
By now you could getting...

BUY NOW! [\[1\]][1]

### Commitment Consistency

People don't like to admit that they have changed their mind [\[1\]][1]
  * if a customer has already committed to believing that something is cheap, or of real value, they may be less willing to change their mind about it [\[1\]][1]

### Scarcity

* in stock, time (time left etc.) [\[1\]][1] 
* FOMO [\[1\]][1]

### Success Stories

* leaders, authorities, people who have had success or are happy with your product

### Conformity

* Evidence of a number of people who have already "done it" [\[1\]][1]

### Emotion and Logic

Put the two together
  * empathy, suffering, experience etc. [\[1\]][1]
  * we all believe that we are smarter than we are [\[1\]][1]
Appeal to their emotion [\[1\]][1] [\[2\]][2]
  * appeal to logic - use facts and figures - e.g. turn £300 into £300,000 [\[1\]][1]
  * ethos - appeal to the customers values - specifically what they believe about themselves [\[1\]][1]
