### Q&A

#### Paul Graham

* How do you know when to launch? [\[1\][1]
  * As soon as you have a quantum of utility, when at least someone loves your solution
  * If you have 10 people who love your solution, but no-one else cares, that's great.
  * There's risk in launching too late too
* How do you decide between building what people need and what they want? [\[2\]][2] 
  * Be careful of developing products for what people need over what they want, when they are very different
  * What people need and want are two different things - need: healthy food, want: junk food
  * What you think they need isn't necessarily what they need
* Is it normal as a founder to see multiple solutions? [\[3\]][3]
  * Yes, pick the one that gets usage quickest
