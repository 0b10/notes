## What Is On-Page Optimisation

### p22

* changes made to the page itself
* also, it means understanding your niche, keyword research, and web strategy
* meta tags, website URLs, formatting, internal linking, keyword development, on-page placement
* BING loves on-page optimisation and you may find that you will get ranked there because of it

## Keyword Research

### p22

* the value of selecting the right keyword is very high
* authorities like wikipedia can have number one on some keyword

### p23

* it's hard to build a business on 400 searches per month for a keyword
* SEO is not keyword research

## Meta Tags

### p23

* helps SE to understand the name of your page, the information it contains, a search result summary text, and how to treat each page when indexed
* different SE's weigh meta tags differently
* must be complete, accurate, and up to date
* Google uses them in relation with other factors
* each page should have unique meta tags - duplicate tags can hurt your rankings

### p24

* types
  * title
  * description
  * keywords
  * robots
  * ...
* title
  * shows up as the search result title, and tells the SE what the main theme of your site is
  * it also shows at the very top of your web browser
  * as a rule of thumb it should be less than 65 chars and less than 7 words - which is the maximum number that is displayed in search results
  * the more words you have, the less weight each one has
  * focus it on very specific keywords - the main theme
  * you can use multiple keyword phrases: "Internet Marketing | Marketing Secrets"
  * Google understand the pipe | as a separator for keywords

## Description

### p26

* using keywords twice in the description can have an impact on other SE's, like BING
  * but make it natural
  * don't do it more than twice - don't do keyword stuffing either - these can have a negative impact

## Keywords

### p26

* the keywords tag should contain your main keywords, and those associated with the main theme of your web page - e.g. the main keyword for the entire site, and the keyword for the single web page
* avoid keyword stuffing, SE's hate it - don't do it in the content, and don't do it in meta tags
* don't list keywords consecutively not "marketing, marketing tips, seo", do "marketing, seo, marketing tips" - this may avoid issues related to keyword stuffing detection
* use a comma and a space to separate keywords
* failing this means your site won't be indexed properly

## Robots

### p27

* This is done every few days
* aids indexing
* make sure this meta tag is included - make it indicate "all"
* you can submit pages directly to the SE, but crawlers do this work for you

## URLs

### p27

* having the primary keyword in your URL can help in some cases (link building), but it does not ranke your page any better
  * it helps with Yahoo and BING
  * it help when you are link building

### p28

* when link building, use the keywords used for that page in the URL 
* you can buy aged domains that have traffic flowing to them, and use the keywords that you are interested in, to get an initial jump in traffic

* PR: Page Rank
