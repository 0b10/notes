# How to Understand Things

## Key Takeaways

* **Go slow**: read slowly, think slowly, ponder the topic, don't just parrot the lessons;
* **experiment**: validate what you learn -- if necessary. Get the data yourself -- don't depend entirely on reading;
* **use different angles**: attack the problem from different angles, solve the same problem in multiple ways -- it forces you to understand more deeply;
* **write it down**: it forces clarity. If you can't explain it in words, you don't understand it;
* **have purpose**: don't commit to learning until you know it's necessary. Use the **framework** below;
* **choose sources carefully**: prefer journals, university presses -- information dense sources. Supplement with books, but consider the author;
* **ask questions**: don't concern yourself with looking stupid;

## Understanding

Rushing learning encourages only a surface level of understanding. Schools and universities have a schedule to keep to, it forces students to move on before understanding, and encourages them to only be able to mechanically reproduce what they've learned to pass an exam.

An anecdote from the book *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance* describes a girl that couldn't think for herself:

> She was blocked because she was trying to repeat, in her writing, things she had already heard.

> She couldn't think of anything to write about Bozeman because she couldn't recall anything she had heard worth repeating.

There is always room to understand something more deeply:

> If your pictures aren't good enough, you're not close enough -- Robert Capa

## Resources

Fermi hinting at using your resources wisely:

> A competent thinker will be reluctant to commit himself to the effort that tedious and precise thinking demands -- he will lack 'the will to think' -- unless he has the conviction that something worthwhile will be done with the result of his efforts -- Enrico Fermi

### Framework

To really address some lack of knowledge, spend some time thinking about the problem, what it is that you want to know -- formulate a question, or a few. Then break each question down into a **semantic mental framework** to guide your research, e.g.:

* How to address water scarcity?
  * Where does existing drinking water come from?
  * How much water is there in the world?
  * How to turn seawater into drinking water?

> Reading popular science books or news articles is not a substitute for understanding, and may make you stupider, by filling your mind with narratives and stories that don;t represent your own synthesis.

Prefer information dense sources over popular books -- like journals, or university presses. You can supplement that reading with books.
